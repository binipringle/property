## Standing

Article III, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution provides that "the judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority;-- [...] to controversies to which the United States shall be a party;-- [...] between two or more states;-- between a state and citizens of another state;-- between citizens of different states;-- between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states, and between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects." Article III, Section 2 has been interpreted to mean that federal courts of the United States can only hear live cases and controversies, and cannot not provide merely advisory opinions. One of the justiciability doctrines that governs federal courts is "standing," which requires a plaintiff to establish that they have a sufficient stake in a lawsuit to (1) give rise to an Article III "case or controversy" and (2) satisfy the U.S. Supreme Court’s judge-made "prudential limitations." The Court has said that the federal judiciary should decline on prudential grounds to adjudicate generalized grievances shared by all or a large class of citizens." *Lexmark v. Static Controls* (2014). Policies underlying the doctrine of standing are adverse presentation of issues (courts want cases to be vigorously litigated [this ensures fairness]); autonomy (favors placing litigation of rights in the hands of those most affected) and additional separation of powers and federalism considerations.

To show that they have (1) a live stake in the outcome of the case or controversy, a plaintiff must show (a) an actual or imminently threatened injury in fact that is (i) concrete and (ii) particularized (i.e., an injury that affects the plaintiff in a personal and/or individual way). It is not enough to show that a federal statute or constitutional provision has been violated and that as citizens and taxpayers an injury is suffered. *FEC v. Akins*, 524 U.S. 11 (1998). *Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife*, 504 U.S. 555 (1992) (plaintiff lacked standing to bring a suit claiming that development projects in Aswan, Egypt, Mahaweli, and Sri Lanka, funded by the U.S., violated the Endangered Species Act of 1973 because plaintiff failed to show a concrete, discernible injury as opposed to a "conjectural hypothetical one"). However, in *Akins* the court recognized that a widely shared statutorily defined injury can still count as an Article III injury for standing purposes if it is concrete not abstract, and plaintiff is part of the class of persons entitled to sue. See also *Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins* (2016)** (plaintiff's injuries sufficient to establish standing because FCRA protected individual rather than collective rights and Robins was suing for a violation of his own statutory rights). The plaintiff must also show (b) causation by showing that the alleged harm is “fairly traceable” to defendant’s conduct challenged in the lawsuit and not attributable to an independent third party not before the court. The third of constitutional requirements is (c) redressability. To satisfy this requirement, plaintiff must show that a favorable judicial order in their favor would redress the alleged injury.

To satisfy (2) the U.S. Supreme Court's judge-made prudential limitations on standing, a plaintiff (a) cannot bring a generalized grievance and (b) must not assert third party rights. I.e., a plaintiff does not have standing to assert the rights of a third party (rights of some entity or person other than the plaintiff) unless an exception applies. Prudential limitations on standing do not apply if (i) congress overrides limitations by statute; (ii) enforcement of the challenged policy against the litigant would result indirectly in the violation of a third party's rights; (iii) the challenged policy would preclude or otherwise adversely affect a relationship existing between the litigant and the	third party or parties whose rights are violated; or (iv) there exists a “close relationship” between plaintiff and third party where there is a “hindrance” to the right-holder’s ability to protect their own interests. Even if a Plaintiff demonstrates an Article III case or controversy, the court may decline to adjudicate the case if the prudential limitations are not satisfied. *City of Los Angeles v. Lyons*, 461 U.S. 95 (1983)(a party must establish standing for every type of relief sought and when seeking injunctive relief, there must be a showing of a reasonable likelihood that plaintiff themself will be subjected to the harm again).

**Recognized Article III injuries:**

- Economic 		- Freedom from restraint
- Contract harms	- Constitutional rights
- Property 		-Statutorily created interests
- Aesthetics/others [study/observe animals in the wild (Lujan)]

**Application/Explanation**

Here, it is likely/unlikely that the Court will find that the plaintiff has standing.

**(a) INJURY**

First, the Court will determine whether or not there is an Article III case or controversy by determining if there is an actual or threatened injury in fact.

Here, there was/was not an actual or threatened injury in fact because ... plaintiff must show an “injury” that is (i) “concrete”[^3] and “particularized”[^4] (as opposed to “abstract” and “undifferentiated”); and (ii) “actual” or “imminent”[^5] (as opposed to “speculative” or “remote”.

**Case examples:**

- In *Allen v. Wright* 468 U.S. 737 (1984), the Court found that a nationwide class of Black schoolchildren did not have standing to bring a claim against the IRS for providing tax exemptions to segregated, white private religious schools, in part, because the alleged injury that Black schoolchildren were harmed because the government gave financial aid to discriminatory private schools was too abstract.[^2]
- In *Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife*, 504 U.S. 555 (1992), the plaintiffs did not have standing when they challenged a statute that restricted the applicability of an endangered species act to only domestic actions and not international actions, alleging that this would allow for extinction of endangered species abroad. There, the plaintiffs alleged that their threatened injury was that they would not be able to scientifically observe or study, or aesthetically appreciate these animals once there were extinct. The Court, however, found there was no injury because the plaintiffs, who had previously travelled abroad to observe these animals, had no plans or plane tickets to go abroad. **PARENTHETICAL:**  *Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife* (1992) (plaintiff lacked standing to bring a suit claiming that development projects in Aswan, Egypt, Mahaweli, and Sri Lanka, funded by the U.S., violated the Endangered Species Act of 1973 because plaintiff failed to show a concrete, discernible injury as opposed to a "conjectural hypothetical one").
- In *FEC v. Akins*, 524 U.S. 11 (1998), the Court held that plaintiffs could allege widely shared harms so long as those harms are concrete and not abstract, as they were here where a group of voters sued the FEC seeking disclosure under FOIA of certain information regarding AIPAC campaign contributions.
- In *Clapper v. Amnesty International USA*, 568 U.S. 398 (2013), the court found that the threatened injury of the phones of human rights lawyers communicating with their clients was not imminent enough because it was not certainly impending, meaning it was too speculative. Thus, there was not injury in fact.
- In *Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus*, 573 U.S. 149 (2014), the court found that a pre-enforcement challenge, or a threatened injury, was sufficiently imminent because the plaintiff alleged an intention to engage in a course of conduct that would make an Ohio law pose a significant risk to a plaintiff’s legally protected interest.
- In  *City of Los Angeles v. Lyons*, 461 U.S. 95 (1983), the plaintiff’s past injury of being placed in a chokehold, which gave rise to a damages claim, did not in and of itself give rise to a claim for a prospective injunction against that conduct in the future. Thus, Lyons did not have standing to seek the injunction unless he could show that the future harm was substantially likely by applying these six factors: (1) challenged conduct is authorized by official policy (here the chokehold policy), (2) plaintiff was subjected to the conduct more than once (here, Lyons was only stopped for a broken taillight and placed in a chokehold once), (3) many instances of challenged conduct (here, only happened to Lyons once, even though there were statistics that this happened all over LA), (4) Defendant is not a state or local law enforcement entity (here, LAPD was), and (5) class action (had Lyons brought this as a class action, there may have been standing).

**(b)	CAUSATION**

Here, there was/was not causation that is fairly traceable to the defendant’s actions.  (“fairly traceable” to defendant’s conduct challenged in the lawsuit and not attributable to an independent third party) [^6]

**Case examples:**

- In *Allen v. Wright* (1984), the Court found that a nationwide class of Black schoolchildren did not have standing to bring a claim against the IRS for providing tax exemptions to segregated, white private religious schools, in part, because the alleged injury that Black schoolchildren were harmed because the government gave financial aid to discriminatory private schools was too abstract, and thus could not be fairly traced to the defendant, IRS’s actions.
- In *Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l* (2013), the plaintiffs did not have standing because the court found that the threatened injury of the phones of human rights lawyers communicating with their clients was not imminent enough because it was not certainly impending, meaning it was too speculative. Thus, there was not an injury in fact that could be fairly traceable to a defendant’s actions.

**(c) REDRESSABILITY**

Here, there was/was not redressability in terms of relief the court can afford. (plaintiff must show that a favorable judicial order in their favor would redress the alleged injury.)

**Case examples:**

- In *FEC v. Akins* (1998), the plaintiffs did have standing and the Court finds that their injury is redressable because the group of voters sued the FEC for information regarding AIPAC campaign contribution under FOIA, and the Court could direct that their FOIA request be granted, even though the information they get may or may not cover all of the relief they sought.

**(d) GENERALIZED GRIEVANCE**

Here, the plaintiff is bringing/is not bringing a generalized grievance because ... the ban on generalized grievances, defined narrowly as “suits ‘claiming only harm to [the plaintiff's] and every citizen's interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large’”, must now be considered an Article III constitutional limitation on standing. Note that a “generalized grievance” as defined above involves only “abstract” harm.)[^7]

**Case examples:**

- In *FEC v. Akins* (1998), the plaintiffs had standing and the Court found that their request as a group of voters suing the FEC for information regarding AIPAC campaign contribution disclosures was not a generalized grievance because Congress created FOIA and Congress can authorize standing for individuals suffering statutory defined injuries even if those injuries are shared by many citizens, so long as the injury is concrete and particularized and the statute identifies the right, relates it to a group of people and authorizes the suit.

**(2) PRUDENTIAL LIMITATIONS**

Second, the Court will determine if the plaintiff's standing may still be limited by non-constitutional, judge-made prudential limitations.

Here, there are/are not assertions of third party rights. (see rule for i, ii, iii and iv)

**Case examples:**

- In *Allen v. Wright*, the Court found that a nationwide class of Black schoolchildren did not have standing to bring a claim against the IRS for providing tax exemptions to segregated, white private religious schools, in part, because it seemed that the plaintiffs were asking the court regulate the rights of a third party (the religious schools) in a particular way.
- In *Pierce v. Society of Sisters*, 268 U.S. 510 (1925), parents had standing because the parents, who were third parties, had the substantive due process right to educate their children, even though the case was about Nebraska law that prevented any schools from teaching children any non-English language and thus impacted private schools.
- In *Griswold v. Connecticut*, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), there was standing because enforcement of law criminally punishing medical providers for providing birth control resulted violated the rights of third party patients seeking birth control.

**CONCLUSION**

Thus, the Court will find that the plaintiff has/does not have standing.

---

[^2]:In *Lexmark v. Static Controls* (2014), the Supreme Court held that zone-of-interests test from *Allen v. Wright* is no longer to be considered part of standing analysis, but relates instead to whether a particular statute confers a right of action on the plaintiff.  The zone-of-interests test will appear as part of the standing rule statement in many pre-2014 judicial opinions; those rule statements are no longer correct.  

[^3]:An injury is a “concrete injury" if it is (1) “tangible” (physical, financial, economic); (2) “intangible” injuries may be concrete if they (a) abridge constitutional rights (free speech, free exercise, privacy, etc); (b) infringe upon other “intangible” interests previously recognized by the Court (environmental, aesthetic, etc.); (c) are historically recognized injuries (Alito gives the example of “qui tam” actions (bounty actions) (Legal Definition of qui tam action: an action that is brought by a person on behalf of a government against a party alleged to have violated a statute especially against defrauding the government through false claims and that provides for part of a penalty to go to the person bringing the action) which American and English courts have entertained for centuries (see e.g. the excerpt from Marvin v. Trout, 199 U.S. 212 (1906), discussed in class – and quoted on the class scroll.); (d) Congress may create statutory rights the invasion of which constitute “concrete injury” (see Kennedy’s Lujan concurrence). However, as the Court stated in Spokeo, a plaintiff does not “automatically” satisfy the injury requirement “whenever a statute grants a person a statutory right and purports to authorize that person to sue to vindicate that right.”  The Court will decide for itself whether violation of the statutory interest causes a “concrete” injury.  Violation of a statutorily-created “procedural right” counts as concrete injury if that procedural violation increases “the risk of real harm” to the plaintiff or otherwise affects the plaintiff’s concrete interests. (For example, see the Spokeo majority’s discussion of what Robins would have to allege to satisfy this requirement – and Ginsberg’s dissent arguing that plaintiff had already made the requisite allegations.)  A “bare procedural violation” without more (i.e., absent any impact some “actual,” “concrete” interest of the plaintiff) does not count as a “concrete injury.”

[^4]:Justices all seem to agree that a violation of voting rights affecting an entire population would cause each individual voter a “particularized” injury. “Widely shared harms” (even harms that may extend to the public at large) may nevertheless be “particularized” and count as Article III injury if they are “concrete” and not “abstract.”  For example, wholesale violation of an individual constitutional right (e.g., imposition of a poll tax in violation of the 24th Amendment) would harm all or most citizens, and each of them would have an Article III injury. Each person’s injury would be “particularized”, even though millions of people suffer exactly the same harm.  See discussion in *Akins*.

[^5]:Note the concession in footnote 5 that the "certainly imminent" standard may not always apply.  Later cases, including Driehaus, alternatively use “significant risk” as the standard for determining whether a threatened injury gives rise to an Art. III case or controversy.  Compare Justice Breyer's explanation in his Clapper dissent.

[^6]:Note the issue of multiple links in the causal chain, especially where some links in the chain involve actions of third parties not before the court (e.g. Allen v. Wright; Linda R.S.; Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization).  Multiple links in the causal chain between the challenged action and the injury are not necessarily fatal, but the Court will scrutinize such chains to determine if the causal links are strong enough, especially where the suit seeks an order requiring the government to enforce laws against third parties (see e.g., Allen and Lujan, where the Court invoked separation of powers and Art. II §3 “take care clause” arguments as justification for applying the causation requirement more strictly).   Note that the court’s characterization of the injury may affect the length of the causal chain and may alter the causation analysis (recall class discussion of Linda R.S. and Bakke.)

[^7]:What rules emerge from Lujan and Kennedy’s concurrence in that case; from Akins; and from the explanation of “concrete” injury in Spokeo?). Consider these hypos, some of which we discussed in class. Why does the Freedom of Information Act’s authorization of private suits comport with Art. III? (Assume that it does!)  Could Congress grant “every citizen” a “right” to “a federal government that obeys the Constitution” and authorize federal lawsuits by any citizen who alleges her right has been abridged?  (Why not?) Could Congress confer upon each citizen a “right to clean air” and authorize citizens to bring federal suits against any entity (public or private) that acts in ways that abridge that right (including, e.g., governmental failure to enforce the Clean Air Act properly)?  Do you think it matters -- for purposes of the Supreme Court's standing analysis -- whether the "citizen suits" are brought against private parties or against the government? (Why?)  Note the dictum in the Lexmark footnote defining a set of “generalized grievances” that do not satisfy Art III’s “injury” requirement. (Congress may not authorize lawsuits that assert only a “generalized grievance” as narrowly defined in Lexmark.

## Eleventh Amendment

The 11th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides that "[t]he judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state." The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted this to presuppose the existence of “state sovereign immunity” that limits Congressional power to abrogate this immunity in federal courts (*Seminole Tribe*); in state courts (*Alden*) and immunized state defendants from federal administrative proceedings by private parties (*Federal Maritime Comm’n*).

"11th Amendment immunity (including allied principles of state sovereign immunity) (1) limits the power of the federal judiciary to hear claims (2) brought by plaintiffs other than the U.S. or another State (3) against state defendants (States, their agencies, an “arm of the state,” and state officers sued in their official capacities); unless (4) the State has unequivocally waived its 11th A immunity or (5) Congress has unequivocally abrogated that immunity through exercise of a power that authorizes abrogation (*Seminole*). In *Seminole Tribe* (1996), the Supreme Court held that Congress has no authority under the commerce clause to abrogate states’ 11th Amendment immunity, and suggested that no Article I power authorizes abrogation.[^9]

The Court has, however, acknowledged that the “civil rights power” conferred by section 5 of the 14th amendment[^9] gives Congress authority to abrogate 11th Amendment immunity." (*Seminole Tribe*). "If the state has waived or Congress has abrogated 11th Amendment immunity, then the state may be sued to that extent as if it were a private party. If, on the other hand, the 11th Amendment applies, it bars any private suit against the state itself, a state agency or an “arm-of-the-state.

A plaintiff may still maintain an “Ex parte Young suit” against a state official sued in their official capacity, but only on a federal claim for “prospective relief”; i.e., relief “necessary to halt an ongoing violation of federal law,” and related "ancillary" relief (e.g., attorneys fees authorized by statute). Retrospective relief (e.g., monetary damages) is not available under *Ex parte Young*, nor is any relief on a state law claim (*Pennhurst*). An Ex parte Young suit is not permitted if plaintiff’s claim rests on a federal statute that contains an express statutory remedy and the Court concludes that Congress intended the statutory remedy to be exclusive. (*Seminole*). Courts may infer such intent where the statutory remedy is “detailed and comprehensive” and where the relief it provides is narrower than the relief available in an Ex parte Young suit."

| Claim | Retrospective (e.g. damages) | Prospective (e.g. injunction) |
| State law claim | NO: Federal courts cannot hear state law claims against state officials | NO: Federal courts cannot hear state law claims against state officials |
| Federal law claim | NO: Plaintiff cannot get damages when suing state official in their official capacity	|YES: Plaintiff can get injunctions to prevent future violations (Ex parte Young)|

**ANALYSIS**

At issue is whether or not the federal court has the authority, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment and related state sovereign immunity principles, to award plaintiff the requested relief.

OR

Here, the Court will likely find that the statute/act/law validly/invalidly abrogates/waives/falls under an Ex parte Young exception, and thus authorizes/does not authorize plaintiff’s suit.

**(1) DOES 11 A IMMUNITY APPLY**

First, the Court will determine if Eleventh Amendment Immunity, including allied principles of state sovereign immunity applies, and thus limits the power of the federal judiciary to hear claims brought by plaintiffs other than the U.S. or another state against state defendants.  

The first question is who is bringing the claim against who and where we are (in state or federal court). *has to involve state actors and has to be a federal court claim - has to be private citizens suing state actors in a federal court - or arm of the state (if it any way implicates the state as in police - remember local police working with state police to perform duties of the state they become arm of the state)* (see table above)

**Case examples**

**State, arm of the state, defendant not state**

- In *Seminole Tribe*, the plaintiffs were a tribe suing the state of Florida, a state defendant.

**Federal claim or state claim**

- In *Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman*, 465 U.S. 89 (1984), the plaintiff had a disability and sued Pennhurst State School under state and federal law. The lower court found that the plaintiff had a federal law claim, but the Supreme Court found that the plaintiff did not have a federal claim, and on remand, a federal appellate court found that the state law supported the plaintiff's claim. So, the school appealed on the grounds that the Eleventh Amendment prohibited a federal court from ordering state officials to comply with the provisions of state law, and the Court agreed. Although the Eleventh Amendment allows the Court to assume jurisdiction when there is a controversy between the citizen of a state with another state, the Constitution did not contemplate the extension of federal jurisdictional authority over suits against states that do not consent to be parties to litigation, and the same applies to the exercise of federal jurisdiction over suits brought by a citizen against his own state.
- In *Alden v. Maine*, Alden, a probation officer, sued the State of Maine over overtime provisions under the Fair Labor Standards Act seeking damages. Alden first brought the case in federal court where it was dismissed on SSI grounds, so he then brought it in state court. The Court held, however, that Congress's Article I powers do not grant it power to subject non-consenting states to private suits for damages even if filed in state courts, even on federal claims, without the state government's consent. **The meaning of Alden:** States have a constitutional immunity from federal law claims brought by individuals in the state’s own courts.  Congress may not abrogate this immunity unless exercising its power under §5 of the 14th amendment (or, presumably, under other powers conferred on Congress at the expense of state autonomy after adoption of the 11th amendment).  Alden holds, in essence, that the same state sovereign immunity rules applicable in federal court apply equally to private suits alleging federal claims against states in their own courts.
- Meaning of *Federal Maritime Comm’n:* states enjoy immunity from federal administrative proceedings that (a) closely resemble judicial proceedings and (b) are initiated by a private party.  

**DO ANY EXCEPTIONS APPLY**

Second, the Court will determine if one of the three exceptions to state sovereign immunity applies.

A state defendant is immune from suit by a plaintiff who is not another state or the United States; unless (1) the state has unequivocally waived its immunity (conditional spending elements)[^10]; (2) Congress has unequivocally abrogated that immunity through exercise of a constitutional power that authorizes abrogation (not commerce clause - Seminole Tribe) and expresses its intent to do so in the text of a statute; or (3) an Ex Parte Young suit exists where “Private plaintiffs may maintain a federal suit against (i) a state official in official capacity; (ii) only for “prospective relief” (no damages only declaratory/injunctive); (iii) on a federal law claim (not state law claims); (iv) “unless Congress has expressed an intent to foreclose Ex parte Young suit”

*KEEP IN MIND: Abrogation: “The court will ONLY look at the text of the statute; it will not infer congressional intent when determining whether part 1 of the test is met and made the abrogation unmistakably clear.”*

**Ex Parte Young exception:** Private plaintiffs may maintain a federal suit against (a) a state official in official capacity; (b) only for “prospective relief;” (c) on a federal law claim (but not on state law claims); (d) unless Congress has expressed an intent to foreclose Ex parte Young suit. In an Ex Parte Young suit, the basic rule is that “relief necessary to halt an ongoing violation of federal law” -- and any "ancillary relief" (relief in aid of the primary relief, such as attorneys’ fees or notice to class members) -- is "prospective" relief permitted by the 11th amendment, even if the relief requires expenditures of state funds. Relief not necessary to halt a present violation of federal law, but that serves only compensatory or deterrent interests, is "retrospective" relief and is not available through an Ex Parte Young suit.

**Waiver**

States may "waive" their 11A immunity, but the Court has set an extremely high threshold for finding waiver, and construes waivers narrowly. (As with abrogation, waiver is not "all or nothing."  A state that has waived its immunity may be sued only to the extent of the waiver, which be qualified, e.g., limited to certain forms of relief.)  General waivers of sovereign immunity by a state have been held insufficient to waive 11A immunity; the Supreme Court requires that the state expressly waive its immunity to suit in federal court in order for a federal action to go forward.  The Court will not imply waiver from a state’s participation in a federal program and agreement to obey federal standards, and the Court seems unwilling to find any constructive waiver of state sovereign immunity (e.g. Edelman) except where a State’s litigation actions amount to a consent to federal jurisdiction.  E.g., Lapides v. Bd. of Regents (2002) (implied waiver of SSI where state agency voluntarily removed a lawsuit from state court to federal court).  Congress may require states to waive their 11A immunity as a condition of receiving federal funds, and courts will enforce the waiver if Congress has set forth the condition in very clear terms. (This is in essence another “clear statement rule,” akin to the “clear statement rule” applied in the abrogation context.) (Cf. Pennhurst)

**Case examples**

- In *Edelman v. Jordan*, 415 U.S. 651 (1974), the Court held that the Eleventh Amendment prohibits federal courts from awarding money damages to citizens against a state, although the Court can order injunctions. Here, the federal court ordered the state of Illinois to pay money damages to people who were harmed due to Illinois' non-compliance with certain provisions of the Aid to the Aged, Blind, or Disabled (AABD) Act and also ordered an injunction to cease their non-compliance with the program. The Supreme Court reversed the award of money damages, but allowed the injunction. Here, the Court also held that Illinois did not constructively waive its immunity through participation in AABD, and waiver will only be found where it was expressly stated. (federal court order requiring state, from the date of the order forward, to obey federal law in administering the state’s public assistance program is "prospective" relief; the relief is "necessary to halt an ongoing violation of federal law" and is therefore not barred by the 11A.  By contrast, an order requiring the state to refund all the benefits it illegally withheld in the past is "retrospective" relief; this relief is not necessary to end a continuing violation of federal law, and since the relief would be paid for from the state treasury, it is barred by the 11A.)
- In *Milliken v. Bradley* 418 U.S. 717 (1974), there was a federal court order that Michigan fund a special education program to remedy the current effects of past de jure desegregation in the public schools, held to be "prospective" relief; current effects of past unconstitutional behavior said to be present constitutional violation; relief is therefore "necessary to halt an ongoing violation of federal law," even though it addresses harms caused by past unconstitutional state action. "The Supreme Court's decision required the City of Detroit's school district to redistribute the relatively small number of white students more widely across the district. According to Wayne State professor John Mogk, the decision also enabled the 'white flight' that re-entrenched the city's segregation. The Detroit Public Schools became even more disproportionately black over the next two decades (with 90% black students in 1987).This result reaffirmed the national pattern of city schools attended mostly by Black people, with surrounding suburban schools mostly attended by Whites." (Wikipedia)

**Congressional abrogation**

Congress may "abrogate" (remove, override) a state’s SSI if (a) Congress "unequivocally" expresses its intent to do so in the text of a statute (the normal rules of statutory construction do not apply here; the Court will not consider legislative history or resort to usual tools of statutory analysis, even though these may reveal a clear congressional intent to override the 11A; the statute need not use “magic words” [e.g., abrogation, 11th Amendment, sovereign immunity, etc.] but must make clear that it authorizes private suits against a state defendant); or (b) Congress has enacted the statute in the exercise of a constitutional power that the Court finds authorizes nullification of SSI. Thus far, the Court has held that Congress has the authority to abrogate SSI under section 5 of the 14th amendment and has suggested in Seminole Tribe and Alden that no Article I power gives Congress the authority to abrogate. However, in Katz (2006) the Court held that the bankruptcy clause of Article I §8 itself represents a surrender of states’ state sovereign immunity in certain bankruptcy proceedings.[^11]

*Civil Rights Enforcement Power will NOT be tested but we are expected to know that Congress may abrogate state sovereign immunity through a valid exercise of the civil rights power*. Sources: Sec. 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment; Sec. 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment; Sec. 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court has held that section 5 grants Congress a broad power -- akin to its “necessary and proper” power -- to select the means to carry out the goals of the 14th amendment.  A statute is “appropriate legislation” under section 5 of the 14th amendment if it is “plainly adapted” to securing due process or equal protection and is “not prohibited by, but is consistent with the letter and spirit of the Constitution.”  Congress may legislate to "remedy, prevent or deter" violations of 14th amendment rights, and it may choose to prohibit conduct that is not itself unconstitutional as the means of remedying, preventing or deterring constitutional violations.  However, after Boerne, there must be a “congruence and proportionality” between the 14th amendment injury Congress seeks to deter or remedy and the means Congress adopts to achieve that end.   (Understand why the Court concluded that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act failed this "congruence and proportionality" test.) *Kimel* refines the test for determining whether Congress has acted within its section 5 power. *Shelby County* invalidates section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.

**Case examples**

- In *Seminole Tribe*, the Court held that Congress did not have authority to validly abrogate states' sovereign immunity through an exercise of power not derived from § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Although Congress unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate state sovereign immunity with respect to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), the abrogation was unconstitutional.
- In *Katz*, the Court held that states had ceded their claims to state sovereign immunity as to bankruptcy proceedings by virtue of the power granted to Congress in the Bankruptcy Clause.
- In *Ex Parte Young*, the Court ruled that private actions may be brought in federal court against state officials, even though states have sovereign immunity. The State of Minnesota had enacted legislation regulating railroad rates, where if a railroad company charged rates in excess of the approved amount, its officers and employees were subject to misdemeanor or felony convictions, fines, and potentially lengthy jail sentences. Plaintiffs alleged that the law violated their 14th Amendment due process rights. The Court found that if a state officer is attempting to enforce a statute that is void as unconstitutional, then the officer may be held liable as an individual acting in his or her official capacity. Federal courts typically cannot enjoin state criminal proceedings. However, if the federal action is started prior to the state proceedings, the federal court holds jurisdiction in both civil and criminal matters to the exclusion of state courts. Federal courts may not, however, interfere in a case where state criminal proceedings are commenced prior to the federal action. In this case, the statute was invalid on its face, because the penalty provisions directing criminal charges and potential imprisonment violate due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, Young could be sued in his individual capacity as a state officer, because he seeks to enforce an unconstitutional statute. The Court found that injunctive and declaratory relief were proper remedies to prevent enforcement of the illegal statute. In his angry dissent, Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote that this suit was only brought because the defendant was an officer of the state, so it was no different from a suit against the state itself, prohibited by the Eleventh Amendment.
- In *Seminole Tribe*, the Court held that Congress did not have authority to validly abrogate states' sovereign immunity through an exercise of power not derived from § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Although Congress unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate state sovereign immunity with respect to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), the abrogation was unconstitutional.

**CONCLUSION**

Thus, the federal court does/does not have the authority, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment and related state sovereign immunity principles, to award plaintiff the requested relief.

**Summary of rule and notes from class:** State defendants (state, state agency, arm-of-state, state officials in official capacity) are immune from private suits (suits by plaintiffs other than the U.S. or another U.S. state) in any federal or state court or quasi-judicial federal administrative proceeding, unless the state has waived its immunity or Congress has validly abrogated it, or the “Ex Parte Young exception” applies. Schematic view of 11A impact, assuming (a) suit in federal court; (b) against a "state defendant" (see above); (c) commenced by plaintiffs other than the United States or another state; and (d) State has not waived and Congress has not validly abrogated State's sovereign immunity. *Understand the theory of Ex Parte Young.  Clarify the impact of Seminole Tribe on the availability of Ex Parte Young actions against state officials.  What is the standard for determining whether Congress intended to foreclose an Ex Parte Young suit?*

**LOFFREDO'S ELEVENTH AMENDMENT ANALYSIS FROM SAMPLE FINAL:**

Analysis 3: The court should deny the motion to dismiss because the EPA validly abrogates defendants’
sovereign immunity and authorizes plaintiff’s suit. In the alternative, if the court concludes that Congress does
not have authority under section 5 of the 14th A to enact the EPA, the court should grant the motion to dismiss
except as to the claim against the state official in official capacity for injunctive relief. The facts describe a suit
in federal court by a plaintiff other than the U.S. or another State against a state agency and its lead official in
his/her official capacity. Hence, the 11th A applies unless the state has waived or Congress has validly
abrogated that immunity. Although there is no indication that the State waived its immunity, Congress has
abrogated that immunity. The EPA satisfies the "clear statement" prong of the Seminole Tribe abrogation test
because the statute’s text unambiguously expresses Congress’s intent to lift 11th amendment immunity by
subjecting state employers to privately-initiated federal suits for damages. The EPA expressly authorizes suits
in “federal district court” for “declaratory or injunctive relief and damages” against “any employer (including a
public agency). . .” and specifically defines “public agency” to include “any State or local government or
agency thereof.” The EPA satisfies the second prong of Seminole Tribe because Congress has the power to
abrogate 11th A immunity under section 5 of the 14th A and, as described above, the EPA constitutes a valid
exercise of section 5. Therefore, plaintiff’s federal EPA claim may proceed against the state agency and its top
official (if s/he comes within the Act’s definition of “employer”) for all the relief authorized by the statute. If
the court concludes that the EPA does not abrogate 11th A, then (1) all of the claims naming the state agency as
a defendant must be dismissed because the 11th A prohibits individual suits against a state or any of its agencies
in federal court; and (2) the claims seeking monetary damages against the state officer in official capacity must
be dismissed, because the 11th A bars such retrospective relief in federal court against any “state defendant”
(state, state agency or official in official capacity, or other entity acting as “arm-of-state”). Finally, even if the
EPA does not abrogate the 11th A, plaintiff could maintain an “Ex parte Young” suit against the state official
for an injunction halting the agency’s policy of discriminating against women in the setting of wages. Such
relief is permissible “prospective” relief, in that it is necessary to halt an ongoing violation of the federal EPA.

[Note: even if the EPA is not sustainable under section 5 of the 14th amendment, it is still valid (minus the
abrogation provision) under the commerce clause and applicable to the states under Garcia. (See Alden)]
Defendants may argue that the EPA evinces a congressional intent to make the statutory remedy exclusive and
preclude enforcement through Ex parte Young actions. (See Seminole Tribe) Courts will infer such an intent if
a statute prescribes a detailed and comprehensive enforcement scheme, especially where the relief available
under Ex parte Young would exceed the relief authorized by statute. Here, however, there is no indication of
congressional intent to preclude enforcement of the EPA through an Ex parte Young suit. The EPA sets forth a
broad and non-specific scheme for private enforcement, authorizing suits for any unspecified declaratory,
injunctive or monetary relief. And, unlike the highly detailed remedial scheme prescribed by the Indian
Gaming Regulatory Act in Seminole Tribe, the EPA authorizes relief that exceeds any relief available under Ex
parte Young. Hence there is no basis to infer that Congress meant to prohibit enforcement of the EPA through
an Ex parte Young action

[^9]:("The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article." Const. 14th A §5)

[^10]:Congress may use the spending power to induce States to ‘waive’ state sovereign immunity, for instance by making such a waiver a condition of state receipt of certain federal funds. (Congress must set forth the condition clearly in order for the Court to conclude that a state’s acceptance of federal funds works a waiver of immunity.

[^11]:The Court has held that the bankruptcy clause of Article I by its own force abrogates state immunity in certain bankruptcy proceedings (*Central Virginia Comm. Coll.*).

## Spending Power

Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution provides that Congress may tax and spend to pay the national debt, to provide for the common defense, and to advance the “general welfare” of the United States. Under its spending power, "Congress may deploy that power to pay the public debts and provide for the common defense and the general welfare of the United States." Congress may accomplish regulatory goals by imposing conditions on spending which require promises or contracts between the federal government and the recipient, whether the recipient is a private individual or a state. (*Steward Machine*), and the 10th Amendment does not prevent Congress from using its spending power to influence or regulate areas of traditional state concern. Congress may condition a state’s receipt of federal funds on the state’s agreement to abide by certain federal directives (including adopting federal policies, administering federal laws or programs and waiving state sovereign immunity); but the Court has announced that under some extreme circumstances, attaching conditions to federal funds may amount to coercion and therefore exceed the scope of the spending power. (*South Dakota v. Dole*) (*N.Y. v. U.S.*). If Congress induces states to waive their immunity, it must do so clearly so the Court may conclude that a state’s acceptance of federal funds constituted a waiver of immunity. The line between inducement and coercion falls somewhere between *Dole* (where the Court determined the conditional spending was an inducement) and *Sebelius* (where the Court determined the conditional spending attached to the Medicaid Expansion component of the ACA was coercive).

In *South Dakota v. Dole*, The Court outlined a four-part test to evaluate whether a statute is a constitutional exercise of Congress’s spending. Congress may engage in conditional spending when (1) the spending is designed to advance the general welfare (near complete deference to Congress’s legislative judgment on the meaning of general welfare), (2) unambiguous conditions are attached to the receipt of federal funds (clear statement rule), (3) a relatedness requirement that there is some nexus between the conditions and federal interest in the particular national project/program funded/expenditure, and (4) that the conditions do not breach some other constitutional provision, prohibition, or right. Congress has wide, and perhaps unreviewable, authority to define the "general welfare" for which it may make appropriations.

When the condition and spending are part of the same program, the Court is likely to find Congress’s exercise of its spending power constitutional. If a conditional spending program is imposed on states which amends an existing program, the Court will ask whether the spending (1) amends an existing program or (2) creates a “new” program that Congress is requiring states to adopt, by a shift in kind instead of merely in degree. If it amends an existing program, then it is probably a constitutional exercise of Congress’s spending power, but if it creates a new program, then coercion analysis applies, and the Court will ask whether the financial inducement offered by Congress was so coercive as to pass the point at which pressure turns into compulsion. At this point, it is likely the Court will strike down the legislation under the Tenth Amendment (directed solely at a state entity that commands the state in its sovereign capacity to adopt and/or administer a federal law/policy that exceeds the scope of the limitation that the 10th Amendment) provided there is no other lawful way Congress could directly engage in the regulation the conditional spending seeks to effect.

**APPLICATION**

1.	Is the spending designed to advance the general welfare? (or pay national debt or provide for the common defense) (Near complete deference to judgement of Congress, anything short of something outrageous)
2.	Is there a clear statement of conditional spending in the statute where unambiguous conditions are attached to receipt of federal funds?
3.	Is there some nexus between the conditions and federal interest in the particular national project/program funded/expenditure such that it satisfies the relatedness requirement? (Conditions on federal grants may be illegitimate if they are not related to a federal interest.)
4.	Does the statute breach any other constitutional rights?
5.	Does it amend an existing program? Is it part of a new program?
6.	If part of a new program, does the statute cross the line from inducement to coercion? (In *Dole*, Congress conditioned receipt of federal funds on states passing a 21 years of age drinking limit. There, the federal highway funds at issue amounted to .02% of the state’s budget, and the Court held that this amount was low enough that the conditioned spending was persuasive, not coercive. In *Sebelius*, on the other hand, Congress conditioned state Medicaid funding on state’s agreement to adopt a federal Medicaid program as part of the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA). There, the federal government conditioned 10% of the state’s federal budget on the adoption of the Medicaid provision of the ACA, an amount the Court argued left states with “no real choice,” and thus amounted to coercion, and was unconstitutional.

**CONCLUSION**

Thus, [this statute] is/is not a constitutional exercise of Congress’s Article I § 8 spending power.

## Tenth Amendment

GENERAL RULE: U.S. Const.  Art. VI, cl. 2 & 3 provide that the U.S. Constitution and federal laws are “the supreme law of the land” and judges in every state are bound by it, as well as state officers bound by oath to support it, and “any Thing to the contrary notwithstanding.” However, the 10TH Amendment to the US Constitution provides that the powers not delegated to the U.S, nor prohibited to states, are reserved to the states…

The court has expressed that Congress cannot enact federal legislation attempting to "commandeer state legislative processes" because it violates state sovereignty (New York v. U.S). Furthermore, Congress may not order State or local executive or law enforcement officials "to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program" (Printz). Nevertheless, the Court has recognized that Congress may still preempt state acts that touch an area over which Congress has constitutional authority, through (1) express preemption—federal statute explicitly states that federal law is exclusive in a field; (2) implied preemption—Even if federal law is silent, the state law is preempted if federal and state laws are mutually exclusive (in conflict) or local law impedes the achievement of a federal objective or if federal law wholly occupies a field (ie. immigration law); or (3) conditional preemption—Congress can induce states to act by conditioning federal grants so long as (i) the conditions are clearly stated; (ii) they are related to the purpose of the program; and (iii) are not unduly coercive as to leave the state without a choice (Sebelius).

STEP ONE: Classify the Statute:
Sub Rule 1: If the federal statute is one of general applicability (directed at private AND public or only private), or is not directed at states in their sovereign capacity (Condon-sellers DMV data), Garcia precedent applies and there is no judicially enforceable 10th Amendment limitation.

Sub Rule 2: if the statute is directed only at state actors in their sovereign capacity (as law
enforcer, regulator, etc.), then no intrusion on “core of state sovereignty is allowed” (NY v. US & Murphy: anti-commandeering doctrine; Printz: Federal regulatory scheme;) and a 10th amendment limitation applies.

Keep in Mind:
-	Reno v. Condon: SCOTUS found that DPPA constitutional exercise of Congress' Interstate Commerce power and did not violate the 10th Amendment: statute prohibited states from selling personal information from DMV databases – Congress did not require the states to regulate its own citizens in any way.

The 10th A gives states sovereign immunity from federal statutes that invade core spheres if state sovereignty. When Federal government requires states to take action.

---

**Other rule**

At issue is whether or not Congress adopted a statute directed solely at a state entity that commands the state in its sovereign capacity to adopt and/or administer a federal law/policy that exceeds the scope of the limitation that the 10th Amendment places on Congress’s power to regulate under the Commerce Clause.

The 10th Amendment generally bars Congress from adopting statutes directed solely at state entities that command states in their sovereign capacities to adopt and/or administer federal laws/policies or command local authorities to administer federal regulatory programs. The modern court has used the Tenth Amendment to greatly restrict Congress’s ability to legislate in manners that affect states. The Tenth Amendment imposes judicially enforced limits on Congress’s power to create legislation that is aimed at states and impacts the core of state sovereignty.
For statutes of general applicability, which are directed at private actors and states alike, there are no judicially enforced Tenth Amendment limits. See Garcia (FLSA held constitutional as applied to state employers). Under statutes of general applicability, the statute must clearly state that it applies to state actors as well as private actors.  

For statutes that are directed at states in their non-sovereign capacities, there are no judicially enforceable Tenth Amendment limits. See Garcia; Condon. The Court requires that Congress state clearly in the text of the statute of general applicability that the statute applies to state actors (in addition to private entities).

If, however, the statute impacts the core of state sovereignty because it is directed at states in a “sovereign capacity,” meaning in their capacity as law giver, enforcer, or regulator, then the judiciary may enforce Tenth Amendment limits because there is no intrusion allowed on the core of state sovereignty. After N.Y. v. U.S., Congress can’t “commandeer the legislative process” and direct, require, or compel states or local officials to regulate in a certain area and in accordance with a certain regulatory scheme. After Printz, the Tenth Amendment bars Congress from issuing statutes that commandeer local/state executive officials from carrying out a federal legislative regulatory scheme.

The Tenth Amendment does not apply if (1) states agree to participate in a federal regulatory program, and Congress can use its spending powers to induce states to take action in accordance with federal criteria by offering money subject to the constitutional standards outlined in Dole & Sebelius. Tenth Amendment also does not apply if a state agrees to participate in the administration of a federal regulatory scheme either through (2) Conditional preemption (fed govt gives states a choice of regulating, but if the states do not regulate, the federal government will regulate in that area and preempt state regulation--requires clear statement), or (3) preemption (fed govt regulates in an area and bars states from doing so).

**APPLICATION**

The first step is to classify the statute. Is it (1) a statute of general applicability OR a statute directed at states in their non-sovereign capacities or (2) a statute directed at states in their “sovereign capacity” as law giver, enactor, and enforcer?

1.	If it is a statute of general applicability (meaning directed at private entities, or at private entities and a state, e.g. FLSA) then Garcia applies and there are no judicially enforceable Tenth Amendments limits. Court requires that Congress state clearly in the text of the statute of general applicability that the statute applies to state actors.
2.	If is a statute directed at states in their non-sovereign capacities then Garcia applies and there are no judicially enforceable Tenth Amendment limits.

**Case example**

- In *Reno v. Condon*, South Carolina was selling information they got through the DMV to companies/stalkers and Congress enacted a statute barring states from selling information they got from DMVs. South Carolina sued under the Tenth Amendment alleging the DMV statute was directed at states in their sovereign capacity in violation of the Tenth Amendment, but the Court held that the state was acting as a non-sovereign owners/seller of information as a market participant, and thus was could not be judicially protected under the Tenth Amendment.

If it is a statute directed at states (only) in a “sovereign capacity,” then the Court will find that any such intrusion on the core of state sovereignty is not allowed. The judiciary will therefore enforce the Tenth Amendment limits.

**Case Example**

- In *N.Y. v. U.S.*, the Court held that it would distinguish statutes of general applicability from statutes directed solely at states. There, the constitution did not authorize Congress to enact or administer a federal regulatory program directed at states in their sovereign capacity, like the Low Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act, although it could incentivize states to do so. Doing so would require states to legislate according to federal standards which constitutes an unconstitutional commandeering of traditional state policy making functions.
- In *Printz v. U.S.*¸ the Supreme Court held that Congress could not compel state or local officials or executive officers to participate in the administration and enforcement of federal programs, like the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (Brady Act), which required state and local officials to conduct background checks on prospective firearms purchasers, and thus compelled state officials to participate in federal service.

**CONCLUSION**

Congress did/did not exceed its authority under the Tenth Amendment limitations.

**My notes**

The Tenth Amendment currently does not operate as a limit on Congress' power under Article I to (a) regulate private activities or (b) regulate state activities through federal statutes of general applicability (federal statutes that apply equally to state entities and private entities, such as the minimum wage law in Garcia).  In addition, the Tenth Amendment does not limit Congress’s civil rights powers (e.g. section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment). Why not?

With regard to federal statutes that are directed solely at states "in their capacity as sovereigns" (or at state or local officials) the Court will inquire into whether the regulation invades a core sphere of state sovereignty.   This is the rule first set forth in New York v. United States.  The Court there held that federal legislation attempting to "commandeer state legislative processes" by requiring a state legislature to enact federal regulatory standards impermissibly violates state sovereignty.  And in Printz, the Court flatly held that Congress may not order State or local executive or law enforcement officials "to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program."   

By contrast, the Court in these cases recognized that Congress may make federal funds contingent upon state adoption and enforcement of federal standards (so long as the federal inducement does not rise to the level of "coercion") and that Congress may still preempt state action (nullify state acts that touch upon area over which Congress has constitutional authority). Printz also confirms that the Tenth Amendment does not prevent Congress from requiring state judges to enforce federal law.  

Issues to consider:  what counts as legislation directed solely at states or at "states in their sovereign capacity"?  (Why did the Court uphold the Drivers' Privacy Protection Act in Reno v. Condon?)  What counts as "coercion" under the N.Y. v. U.S. analysis? Under Sebelius (the Obamacare case)? Suppose a state legislature had to enact statutory amendments in order to comply with the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.  Does that pose a tenth amendment problem?  Why (not)?

The meaning of Murphy v. NCAA: In essence the Court held that Congress may not (at least though exercise of an Article I power) “issue direct orders to state legislatures” – even if the congressional “order” purports to bar a state legislature from acting as opposed to requiring a state legislature to act (as in New York v U.S.)  [Although the 10th amendment bars Congress from ordering a state legislature not to enact certain laws, Congress may preempt (render null) any laws the state adopts so long as Congress is acting within its delegated powers.]

For example, in Murphy itself, nothing would prevent Congress from outlawing sports betting directly, in which case any law that New Jersey enacted authorizing such betting would be preempted and void under the Supremacy Clause.  What bothered the Murphy Court was that Congress issued an order to state legislatures prohibiting them from adopting such laws.

## Dormant Commerce clause

Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate the channels and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and any activity that substantially affects interstate commerce. States are allowed to regulate commerce, but the commerce clause does not clearly define what power is left to the states where Congress is silent. The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the commerce clause as implying a limitation on state power to regulate commerce, making it both a “positive” grant of power to Congress, and a “negative” constraint upon the states which permits the courts to measure state legislation against commerce clause values even in the absence of congressional regulation, that is, when Congress’s exercise of its power is dormant. This doctrine is known as the dormant commerce clause (DCC).[^7] [^8]

Dormant commerce clause doctrine prohibits state legislation that has a protectionist purpose or discriminates against or unduly burdens interstate or international commerce. "[W]here simple economic protectionism is effected by state legislation, a virtual per se rule of invalidity has been erected. [...] But where other legislative objectives are credibly advanced and there is no patent discrimination against interstate trade, the Court has adopted a [...] flexible approach." *City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey*, 437 U.S. 617 (1978). "Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative public benefit. [...] And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will depend on the nature of the local interest and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities." *Philadelphia v. New Jersey* quoting *Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.*, 397 U.S. 137 (1970).

To defend a facially neutral statute that has an incidental impact on interstate commerce, a state must show (1) a legitimate state interests, rationally related to the means (“means ends fit”) to achieve it. The court, is not required to but will consider and apply the Pike Balancing Test, which provides that the statute will be upheld unless the burden it imposes on interstate commerce clearly outweighs the benefits. To defend a statute which overtly discriminates against interstate commerce, a state must make a “compelling showing” of (1) a neutral, non-protectionist state interest and “convincingly demonstrate” (2) that no less discriminatory means are available to achieve that interest.

The first step is to classify the [statute or regulation]. *Who is regulating? Congress or state? If state, has congress acted or directed?*

Here, the [statute or regulation] is a [statute or regulation] enacted by a state which regulates [commerce that it regulates]. Congress is silent on how [commerce that the statute or regulation regulates]. Therefore, the DCC applies.

**PROTECTIONIST PURPOSE**

The first issue is whether [the statute or regulation] has a protectionist purpose. *What is the statute regulating?*

If the purpose of a statute is protectionist, the statute is deemed unconstitutional and prohibited by the Court under dormant commerce clause doctrine. A statute is protectionist if it intends to benefit "local private economic actors at the expense of out-of-state economic actors". "The Court appears to set forth a categorical prohibition against attempts on the part of any single state to isolate itself from difficulties common to all [states] by restraining the transportation of persons and property across its borders." *Edwards v. California*, 314 U.S. 160 (1941) ("California statute that made it a crime to help a poor person enter the state is unconstitutional").

Here, ... [hoarding]

Therefore, the [statute or regulation] [has / does not have] a protectionist purpose.

**OVERTLY DISCRIMINATORY OR FACIALLY NEUTRAL**

The second issue is whether [the statute or regulation] is overtly discriminatory or facially neutral.

A statute overtly discriminates against interstate commerce if it advances an in-state or local enterprise and burdens out-of-state business. A statute is facially neutral if it does not advance in-state or local enterprise nor burden out-of-state business.  

Here, ... *if law explicitly favors state residents over residents of other states, it is overtly discriminatory*

Therefore, [the statute or regulation] is [overtly discriminatory or facially neutral].

**OVERTLY DISCRIMINATORY TEST**

Rosa's subrule: To defend a statute which facially discriminates against interstate commerce, a state must make a “compelling showing” of (1) a neutral, non-protectionist state interest and “convincingly demonstrate” (2) that no less discriminatory means are available to achieve that interest.

To determine whether an overtly discriminatory statute is permissible under the dormant commerce clause, the court subjects the statute to a type of heightened scrutiny sometimes not unlike equal protection strict scrutiny. The state must make a "compelling showing" (1) of a "neutral, non-protectionist state interest or purpose" that (2) cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.[^9] A facially discriminatory statute may have a non-protectionist state interest.

The first question is whether the state met its burden of showing a neutral, non-protectionist state interest or purpose.

Here, ...

Therefore, ...

The second question is whether nondiscriminatory alternatives were available to achieve the statute or regulation's purpose.

Here, ...

Therefore, ...

Therefore, ...

**PIKE BALANCING TEST FOR FACIALLY NEUTRAL**

Rosa's subrule: To defend a facially neutral statute that has an incidental impact on interstate commerce, a state must show (1) a legitimate state interests, rationally related to the means (“means ends fit”) to achieve it. The court, is not required to but will consider and apply the Pike Balancing Test; which provides that the statute will be upheld unless the burden it imposes on interstate commerce clearly outweighs the benefits.

To determine whether a facially neutral statute is permissible under the dormant commerce clause doctrine, the court applies a standard of review similar to rational basis review, to determine whether the statute discriminates against interstate commerce. "Where the statute (1) [has] a legitimate local public interest, and (2) its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless (3) the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative public benefit. . . And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will depend on the nature of the local interest and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities." *Pike v. Bruce Church* (1970). (the availability of less discriminatory means is considered but not required).

(1) The first question is whether the state interest is legitimate.

Here, the state interest [is / is not] legitimate because .... .

Therefore, ...

(2) The second question is whether the statute's effects on interstate commerce are incidental.

Here, the effect of the statute [is / is not] incidental to the statute's purpose because it [does / does not] have a protectionist purpose *if statute burdens out of state goods only, or if hoarding, then protectionist*

Therefore, ...

(3) The third question is whether the statute is unduly burdensome.

Here, ... *to see if unduly burdensome, discuss state's non-economic interest including state police powers: health, safety and welfare.*[^10]

Therefore, the statute [is / is not] unduly burdensome.

(4) The fourth question is whether there were other means available to achieve the statute's purpose.

Here, the state [could have / could not have] achieved its ends by using less discriminatory means because ... (the availability of less discriminatory means is considered but not required)

Therefore, other means [were / were not] available to the state.

Therefore, the dormant commerce clause [does / does not] prohibit the state's enactment of [the statute] because the state's interest in the statute [is / is not] legitimate, the effects of the statute [are / are not] incidental, the statute [is / is not] unduly burdensome, and the state [could have / could not have] achieved its end by using less discriminatory means.

**EXCEPTIONS**

The next question is whether any caveats, special circumstances or exceptions apply.

A state-enacted statute or regulation with incidental discriminatory effects on interstate commerce is not restrained by the dormant commerce clause if (1) congress consents to or preempts the state legislation; (2) the state is a market participant; or (3) the discrimination is in favor of the state government.  

The first question is whether Congress consented to or preempted [state legislation or regulation].

Here, ...

Therefore, ...    

The second question is whether [state] entered the market as a market participant or a market regulator.

If a state or local government enters the market as a participant as opposed to a market regulator, it is not subject to the restraints of the commerce clause. *White v. Mass. Council of Constr. Employers*, 460 U.S. 204 (1983), citing *Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp.*, 426 U.S. 794 and *Reeves, Inc. v. Stake*, 447 U.S. 429. "The Court’s reasoning is that 'nothing in the purposes animating the commerce clause prohibits a state, in the absence of congressional action, from participating in the market and exercising the right to favor its own citizens over others.' *Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap* (1976)." The market participant exception does not apply where states “impose contract conditions that have a substantial regulatory effect” outside the market in which the state is participating.  If a state imposes conditions or restrictions “downstream from [enduring after and/or reaching beyond] the actual transaction,” it is acting as a market regulator. *South-Central Timber Development v. Wunnicke* (1984) (Contract term requiring purchaser of Alaskan timber to process timber in Alaska prior to export operated as a regulation and therefore was not exempt from DCC scrutiny under the market participant exception.)[^11]  

*A New York State statute directing all private businesses incorporated in the State of New York to purchase their office equipment from distributors located within New York State is market regulation because the state is telling private businesses what to do. A New York statute directing all state agencies to purchase their office equipment from distributors located within New York State is market participation because the state agencies are the state.*  

Here, ...

Therefore, ...

The third question is whether [state statute or regulation] is discriminating in the state's own favor.

While a state may not discriminate in favor of private citizens or actors, it may discriminate in its own favor. *United Haulers Assn. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority*, 550 U.S. 330 (2007) (Flow-control ordinance favoring government but treating in-state and out-of-state private businesses the same did not excessively burden interstate commerce).

Here, ...

Therefore, ...

In Conclusion, ...

**CASES I MIGHT WANT TO ADD AS PARENTHETICALS IN RULE EXPLANATIONS OR APPLICATIONS:**

From DCC scroll 1:

*Philadelphia v. New Jersey* (1978) (Court invalidated a New Jersey statute that prohibited the disposal in New Jersey of solid waste generated outside of the state. "This dispute about ultimate legislative purpose need not be resolved, because [...] the evil of protectionism can reside in legislative means as well as legislative ends.")

*Maine v Taylor* (1986) (Court upheld a Maine statute that barred the importation of live bait fish from out of state because impact was incidental.) *"A much more deferential analysis applies to state statutes that do not patently discriminate against interstate commerce or out-of-state economic interests [...] even though such statutes may have as large or even larger economic impact than some overtly discriminatory statutes."*"

From DCC scroll 2:

*West Lynn Creamery* (1994) ("Massachusetts imposed a non-discriminatory tax on all milk sales within the state." "Massachusetts placed the proceeds of that tax into a special fund, and drew from that fund to subsidize Massachusetts dairy farmers.")

*Carbone v. Clarkstown* (1994) ("Local ordinance requiring that all solid waste generated in the town be disposed of at the town-designated but privately operated waste transfer facility is unconstitutional.") *This case illustrates the difficulty of classifying regulations as patently discriminatory v. facially neutral.*

*Hunt v. Washington State Apple Growers* (1977) ("North Carolina statute that prohibited the labeling of apple crates sold in NC with any grades except U.S. Department of Agriculture grades violates the DCC.") *Facially neutral statute, but SCOTUS invalidated because the Court did not accept the state’s justification for this restriction on interstate commerce (i.e., the Court concluded that the statute did not rationally advance the asserted goal of consumer protection.).*

[^7]:Here is my longer rule: Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate the channels and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and any activity that substantially affects interstate commerce. States are also allowed to regulate commerce. However, the commerce clause does not clearly define what or how much power is left to the states in the absence of congressional action or direction. The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the commerce clause as implying a limitation on state power to regulate commerce (parenthetical). The commerce clause is thus both a “positive” grant of power to Congress, and a “negative” constraint upon the states which permits the courts to measure state legislation against commerce clause values even in the absence of congressional regulation, that is, when Congress’s exercise of its power is dormant. This doctrine is known as the dormant commerce clause (DCC).[^7] [^8] Dormant commerce clause doctrine prohibits state legislation that has a protectionist purpose or discriminates against or unduly burdens interstate or international commerce. "[W]here simple economic protectionism is effected by state legislation, a virtual per se rule of invalidity has been erected. [...] But where other legislative objectives are credibly advanced and there is no patent discrimination against interstate trade, the Court has adopted a [...] flexible approach." *City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey*, 437 U.S. 617 (1978). "Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative public benefit. [...] And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will depend on the nature of the local interest and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities." *Philadelphia v. New Jersey* quoting *Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.*, 397 U.S. 137 (1970).

[^8]:"Congress has the plenary power to regulate the channels, instrumentalities and any activity that substantially affects interstate commerce. However, this authority is not absolute. States are allowed to regulate commerce if such regulation is not preempted by federal law, and so long as the State regulation does not discriminate against out of staters. If the state regulation discriminates on its face against out of staters, it violates the DCC unless the regulation is necessary for a compelling state interest (strict scrutiny). If the regulation does not discriminate against out of staters, it usually will be upheld so long as it does not unduly burden interstate commerce." (Answer A to Question 5 of the July 2018 California Bar Exam)

[^9]: Alternative overtly discrimatory test from juraxbar: “The state must show that it advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives. This is a high standard that the state must meet.”

[^10]:Courts will “weaken the deference traditionally accorded to state safety regulation” when the regulation contains exemptions that reduce the burdens on in-state interests. *Kassel v. Consolidated Freightways* (1981) ("Iowa statute that banned 65-foot double trucks from its roads and highways violated the DCC.") (Iowa failed to present persuasive evidence that the purpose of its statute was health and safety and undermined its purported purpose by including many exemptions in the statute that relieved Iowans of the burdens of regulation.) *All of the states surrounding Iowa permitted such trucks, so the impact of the statute was to force large trucks making east-west long hauls to detour around Iowa (adding hundreds of miles to their routes).*

[^11]:Vaughn note from chat re essay 2: when nys decides to buy local for itself that is market participation, but when it orders private businesses to buy local, that is market regulation.
