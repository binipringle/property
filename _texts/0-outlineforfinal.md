**Marketable Title**

Even if not expressed in purchase contract, every purchase contract contains an implied covenant that the seller will deliver marketable title at the closing, unless the parties agree to a different title standard. Marketable title is title reasonably free from doubt that the seller owns the estate he is selling and there are no encumbrances on the property. A title is doubtful and unmarketable if it exposes the party holding it to the hazard of litigation. If a title problem is discovered shortly before closing, the seller has a reasonable time to cure it unless the contract stipulates that time is of the essence, and then the failure to act within the required time is a breach of contract. Title is made unmarketable by private encumbrances such as an easement or restrictive covenant. Although mere existence of zoning ordinances and similar public regulatory laws does not make title unmarketable, if property under contract violates a public restriction, most courts hold that title is unmarketable. A seller’s failure to clear up violations of either private or governmental restrictions by the date of closing would also mean a failure to deliver marketable title.

**Marketable title is distinct from market value**. For example, the presence of hazardous waste on a property (which might impair the market value of the property) does not make title unmarketable. Obligation to deliver marketable title concerns title to property, not physical condition of property.

Once a buyer accepts the deed at closing, generally she can no longer sue to enforce any obligations imposed on the seller by the contract of sale, including the seller’s (express or implied) promise to deliver marketable title. Unless the parties agree otherwise, all rights under the contract of sale are extinguished or “merged” into the deed.

---

**Application**

Example: If Seller has title to only 25 of 40 acres he agreed to sell, title is not marketable.

Example: Fact that property is located in flood zone does not render title unmarketable because physical conditions or zoning restrictions that lower a property’s value do not render title unmarketable. Only issues relating to title affect marketability.

Example: If Seller claims title by adverse possession but has not prevailed in a suit to quiet(establish) title, her title would not be marketable because not free from reasonable doubt.

---

**Encumbrances of record**

Encumbrances of record that a reasonable buyer ordinarily would object to are mortgages, liens, easements, and restrictive covenants. A buyer can agree in contract to accept “all restrictions...of record” which means they agree to accept a violation of an encumbrance. In *Lohmeyer v. Bower* (Sup Ct Kansas 1951), the court held that violation of private restriction and government ordinance exposes the party holding property to the hazard of litigation and makes such title doubtful and unmarketable. [This is so even though] the contract provides the conveyance was to be made “subject to all restrictions and easements of record” because here it is the property’s violation of the private restriction imposed that renders the title unmarketable.

---

**Merger doctrine**

A deed is a final agreement between buyer and seller concerning seller’s delivery of title and all prior terms between buyer and seller, whether written or oral, are extinguished, that is, they merge into the deed, and are unenforceable. Merger doctrine is a harsh rule of law but all agreements in contract of sale relating to title must be incorporated into deed before parties tender or accept it. The merger doctrine has four exceptions: (1) mutual mistake in drafting final documents; (2) ambiguity in final documents; (3) existence of rights collateral to conveyance of title (i.e., not related to title, such as removing items stored on property); and (4) fraud in transaction.

**Rules for seller disclosure of conditions on the property that is under contract for sale.**

**Modern rule: duty to disclose**

In most jurisdictions, seller of residential real property is obligated to disclose defects (1) they actually know about that (2) materially affect the value of the property and (3) are not known to or readily discoverable by a buyer. Many states impose the same duty on real estate brokers involved in the transaction.

---

**Caveat emptor (old common law rule on disclosure of property conditions)**

Under Common Law doctrine of caveat emptor, seller of real property had no duty to disclose defects to buyer. Instead, buyer had complete responsibility to assess condition of premises. Seller was liable only if they affirmatively misrepresented condition of property, actively concealed its defects, or owed a fiduciary duty to the buyer.

---

**Fiduciary duty**

A fiduciary obligation exists whenever relationship with another involves a special trust, confidence, and reliance on fiduciary to exercise their discretion or expertise in acting for other (a reference to an “arm’s length transaction” means that parties are not in a fiduciary relationship)

----

**Stambovsky**

In *Stambovsky v. Ackley* (App Div 1st Dep’t 1991) (the “Poltergeist case”), the court allowed a narrow exception to caveat emptor where (1) condition is created by seller and (2) **materially** impairs value of contract, (3) is (a) peculiarly within knowledge of seller or (b) unlikely to be discovered by prudent purchaser exercising due care, and (4) nondisclosure is basis for rescission as matter of equity. Stambovsky differs both from modern majority rule and strict caveat emptor rule.[^2]

An objective approach defines “material” as that which affects a reasonable person’s decision to purchase the home. Jurisdictions that apply this approach examine whether the defect significantly decreases the market value of the property or whether a reasonable person would view the defect as important in her decision to purchase. The subjective approach adopted by a few jurisdictions focuses on whether the defect would affect the particular buyer’s decision to purchase the home.

---

**Equitable remedy of rescission**

Rescission is a “retroactive termination” of a contract. The right to rescind does not arise from every breach by the other party but is permitted when breach pertains to the essence of the contract. A party to a contract who is herself in default cannot, however, rescind because of a breach by the other party.

**Application**

Example: Seller knows that the electric wiring in the house is old and brittle. Twenty years ago, while Seller owned the house, there was a small fire caused by a frayed wire in a light switch. Is there a duty to disclose this non-visible condition to buyer? Yes, under majority rule. No, under strict caveat emptor rule if there is mere silence and no fiduciary relationship (but rather an arm’s length transaction), no effort to conceal, and no affirmative misstatements about the wiring. Under Stambovsky, no, unless the Seller had installed the wiring and thus created the defect.

---

**Post-Stambovsky legislative development in NY**

Section 462 of N.Y. Real Property Law requires Seller of residential property (essentially 1- to 4-family dwellings other than coops and condos) to complete and sign a property condition disclosure statement which is to be delivered to a buyer or buyer's agent prior to the buyer signing a binding contract of sale. If Seller fails to deliver a disclosure statement prior to the buyer’s signing a binding contract of sale, the buyer shall receive upon the transfer of title a credit of five hundred dollars against the agreed upon purchase price of the residential real property. (in effect, sellers of covered residential properties may opt out of actual disclosure and thus buyers are not necessarily protected except for $500 credit beyond what Stambovsky required. Stambovsky presumably fully applies to other categories of property.)

Court focused in Stambovsky on the relationship between property reputation and value. Although buyer here probably could have learned about the property’s “haunted“ reputation, court seemed concerned about imposing a high burden on buyers to discover the existence of non-physical defects such as property “stigma.” See [N.Y. Real Property Law §443-A](https://newyork.public.law/laws/n.y._real_property_law_section_443-a) (no duty to disclose fact or suspicion related to occupancy by person having or suspected of having AIDS or where property is associated with homicide, suicide, other death, or felony)

[^2]:In *Stambovsky*, although the buyer was not entitled to damages (remedy at law), he was entitled to go back to court and, if establishing the above requirements, receive his deposit back as part of rescission (equitable) remedy.

**Delivery of deeds and methods of assuring title**

For a deed to be delivered, grantor must have adequate mental capacity to execute a deed. Delivery is required to effectuate transfer of title. Ideally, delivery requires physical transfer and present intent by grantor to transfer interest in property to grantee. There is a presumption of delivery where there is (1) physical transfer; (2) recording of deed; and (3) acknowledgment of deed. Failure to transfer a deed creates a presumption of non-delivery. Grantee’s acceptance is presumed unless conveyance might be disadvantageous to grantee. Conveyance would be disadvantageous if property were a toxic waste site; if maintenance and security for the property are too costly; or if the property has no net value because it is encumbered by liens.

In *Rosengrant v. Rosengrant*, (Court of Appeals of Oklahoma 1981), the court ruled that the grantor’s intent at the time the deed is delivered is of primary and controlling importance.
In this case, the court held that the deed was not legally delivered when Harold handed the deed to his nephew at the bank becasue, based on all the facts and circumstances, the true intent of the parties was expressed by the notation of Harold’s name on the envelope and by the later conduct of the parties in relation to the land, where Harold intended to retain control over land until he and his wife died.

Example: Assume owner of land says:  “Here’s my deed to you. Please hold it safe until I talk with my wife, and then you can record it when I say it’s OK.” Does this constitute effective delivery? No. While the deed was manually transferred to Y, there was no intent to be immediately bound because S wanted to talk with his wife before making a final decision.

**Title**

**English Common Law**

The rule for title disputes in early England was that the person who received her interest first prevailed because a grantor could only convey title once (first in time is first in right). Thus, a later conveyance was ineffective because the grantor had nothing left to transfer. There is a public system of land records in UK.

Public system of land records was developed in the United States where an attorney or buyer can inspect to determine whether anyone other than the seller claims any interest in the land. Anyone holding an estate or interest in land may record a deed or other instrument to give notice of his rights to the world.

Example: Assume Purchaser 1 acquires land and records deed. Purchaser 2 (later in time) is charged with notice of Purchaser 1’s recorded deed to that same land even if Purchaser 2 did not search records, because deed would have been found in a title search. If Purchaser 1’s deed had not been recorded, the interest of Purchaser 2 in the same parcel of land may be protected under one of the Recording Acts, depending on the kind of recording statute in effect and what the statute required. To promote the marketability of real property, as between 1 and 2, under a system of public land records (again, where the requirements of the Recording Act are met) the law chooses to recognize 2 as the owner for public policy reasons even though grantor of second deed no longer had any property left to transfer.

---

**Public Records**

Search for title in public records system: deeds, mortgages, and other documents affecting land title are filed in the public records where they can be located and evaluated. Every state has a method for indexing these deeds, mortgages, and other documents that affect title. The recorder’s office will use one of two systems: (1) the grantor-grantee index, in which every recorded document is indexed in two places (grantee index and the grantor index); or (2) the tract index, which is organized by the parcel involved.

**Bona fide purchaser for value (BFP)**

A bona fide purchaser for value (BFP) is a subsequent purchaser who (i) acquires valid title (ii) without notice of a prior transfer AND (iii) pays valuable consideration for the land commensurate with its value (no gifts).[^7]

Valuable consideration is consideration commensurate with value of land or at least substantial consideration (could be cash, a Klimt painting, forgiveness of loan that seller owed to purchaser, etc.). In all states, lenders as well as buyers qualify as BFPs.

Some recording acts specifically state that mortgagees (lenders who are given a mortgage as collateral for the loan) are entitled to defeat prior unrecorded interests. Other states with acts that refer only to “purchasers” have interpreted the term to include mortgagees. The money they lend to the borrower/mortgagor is valuable consideration. If the lender/mortgagee does not give new value when it takes the mortgage, but relies on a preexisting debt that borrower owes,  in most states the mortgagee is not a “purchaser.” If the mortgagee gives new value by, for example, extending the term of the loan, it will qualify as a BFP who takes free of prior valid unrecorded interests of which it lacks notice.

[^7]:Rosa's rule: BONA FIDE PURCHASER: i. purchaser obtained valid legal title to the challenged property; ii. purchaser paid the value of the challenged property [NO GIFTS]; and iii. purchaser had no knowledge of the claimed interest against the challenged property at the time of the transaction.

---

**Notice**

When we determine whether a subsequent BFP had notice, we must consider three kinds of notice. These are (1) actual notice, (2) record notice and (3) inquiry notice. (1) Actual notice is knowledge of a prior interest. (2) Record notice is notice of any prior interest that would be discovered by a standard search of public land records. (3) Inquiry notice is notice of any prior interest that would have been obtained by investigating suspicious circumstances. Record notice and inquiry notice are forms of constructive notice. The subsequent purchaser is deemed to know the information that she could have learned by examining the public land records or making an appropriate investigation, even if she fails to do so.

Actual notice arises from personal "knowledge of the fact in question.” Implied notice is “[a] factual inference of such knowledge, inferred from the availability of a means of acquiring such knowledge when the party charged therewith had the duty of inquiry." Constructive notice is the inference of such knowledge by operation of law, as under a recording statute.

---

**Recording Act**

Each state has a Recording Act which establishes the method for determining priority between adverse claimants. The three basic types of acts are race, notice and race-notice.

---

**Race jurisdiction**

In a race jurisdiction, the purchaser who records first has priority over a previously created interest, even if she actually knows about that interest. Only North Carolina and Louisiana still have race statutes.[^3]

[^3]:Example: “No conveyance of land . . shall be valid to pass any property, as against lien creditors or purchasers for a valuable consideration  . . But from the time of registration thereof . . “ (North Carolina). Unrecorded conveyance is valid as between the grantor and original purchaser. But to be protected against claims of a subsequent purchaser for value or lien creditor, the purchaser must record before they do.

**Notice jurisdiction**

In a notice jurisdiction, the subsequent bona fide purchaser for value has priority. This purchaser does not have to record in order to gain priority, but purchaser is still motivated to record quickly. If purchaser fails to record, they may lose the interest to a bona fide purchaser subsequent to them. About half of the states use notice statutes. Note: A subsequent purchaser would not be protected if s/he had some other kind of notice (actual or inquiry), or if she did not give valuable consideration.[^4]

[^4]:Example: “No Instrument affecting real estate is of any validity against subsequent purchasers for a valuable consideration, without notice, unless filed in the office of the recorder of the county in which the same lies, as hereinafter provided “ (Iowa)

**Race-notice jurisdiction**

In a race-notice, protection is given to the subsequent bona fide purchaser for value who both takes without notice and records first. Roughly half of the states have race-notice statutes. Note: “in good faith” is often used in place of “without notice.” In a race-notice statute, a subsequent purchaser or mortgagee in good faith must also record before the prior grantee records.   NOTE: first in time rule remains default rule unless the subsequent purchaser qualifies for protection under the state’s Recording Act.

Example: “Every conveyance of real property  .. is void as against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee of the same property, or any part thereof, in good faith and for a valuable consideration, whose [subsequent purchaser’s] conveyance is first duly recorded.” (California)

---

**Special cases**

A forged deed is void, transferring no interest to the grantee. Thus, any subsequent grantees in that chain of title, including bona fide purchasers, receive nothing.

A deed that is induced by fraud is generally voidable by the grantor, but if the defrauding grantee conveys title to a bona fide purchaser before the transaction is voided by the defrauded grantor, the subsequent BFP prevails.

In *McCoy v. Love* (Fla. Sup Ct 1979), the court ruled that if the deed was void, then no legal title passed to the grantee. If the deed was only voidable in equity, then the equitable defenses of laches and of a bona fide purchaser are available. A bona fide purchaser has the right to rely on the record title of their grantor, but this protection extends only to those purchasing a legal title. The recording of a void or forged deed is legally insufficient to create a legal title, and affords no protection to those claiming under it. The rule that a deed procured by fraud is void is limited to situations where the fraud in the execution is such that it can be said there was a complete failure of delivery. The holding in this case was that the deed was merely voidable, and conveyed a legal title to the grantee. The case was remanded for a determination of whether the defendants were bona fide purchasers.

**Chain of Title**

In *Harkless v. Laubhan* (FLA. Dist Ct of App. 2019), the court ruled that a party is a bona fide purchaser only when three conditions are met: (1) the purchaser obtained legal title to the challenged property, (2) the purchaser paid the value of the challenged property, and (3) the purchaser had no knowledge of the claimed interest against the challenged property at the time of the transaction. "A purchaser is not entitled to protection as a bona fide purchaser when he or she takes property with notice of an outstanding interest in the property."

In *Witter v. Taggart* (NY Ct App 1991), where Witter complained of a violation of his scenic easement to an unobstructed view and asserted a right to restrict Taggarts’ use of their land (a negative easement) making his property a benefited or dominant parcel in relation to the Taggarts’ burdened (or servient) parcel and that this right was included in the deed transferred to Witter from Witter’s predecessor in title, the issue was whether the restrictive covenant recited in Witter's chain of title to his purported "dominant" land, which appears nowhere in the direct chain of title to the Taggarts' purported "servient" land,in fact burdened the Taggarts' property.

The rule for determining the ultimate binding effect of a restrictive covenant is that "[i]n the absence of actual notice before or at the time of ... purchase or of other exceptional circumstances, an owner of land is only bound by restrictions if they appear in some deed of record in the conveyance to [that owner] or [that owner's] direct predecessors in title."

TAKEAWAY:Property law principles and practice have long established that a deed conveyed by a common grantor  [Here, Lawrance]to a dominant landowner [that is, Witter’s predecessor in title] does not form part of the chain of title to the servient land retained by the common grantor and later granted to successors in title

Holding: Citing the paramount values of definiteness, certainty, alienability, and unencumbered use of property, and of the recording acts, and consistent with long-standing precedents and property principles, the Taggarts did not have actual or constructive notice of this restrictive covenant because it was never included in their deed or direct chain of title. There being no other imputable constructive or inquiry notice, they are not bound by that covenant. NOTE: One way the dominant landowner or grantor can prevent this result is by recording in the servient chain the conveyance creating the covenant rights so as to impose notice on subsequent purchasers of the servient land.

## Easements

**Rule from LII**

An easement is the grant of a nonpossessory property interest that grants the easement holder permission to use another person's land. There are different kinds of easements. If an easement appurtenant is granted, it involves two pieces of land, where one serves as the servient tenement that bears the burden, and the other the dominant tenement, which benefits from the grant of the easement and has permission to use the servient land in some manner.

There are two types of easements: affirmative and negative. An affirmative easement gives the easement holder the right to do something on the grantor of the easement's land, such as travel on a road through the grantor's land. A negative easement, on the other hand, allows the easement holder to prevent the grantor of the easement from doing something on his land that is lawful for him to do, such as building a structure that obscures light or a scenic view.

Easements can be created in a variety of ways. They can be created by an express grant, by implication, by necessity, and by adverse possession. Easements are transferrable and transfer along with the dominant tenement.

Additionally, easements can also be terminated. An easement can be terminated if it was created by necessity and the necessity ceases to exist, if the servient land is destroyed, or if it was abandoned.

---

**Rule from takeaways**

An **easement** is a right to nonpossessory use of land that generally serves the productive use of land. The parcel of land used by the holder of the easement is the **dominant tenement (or property)**. Because an appurtenant easement is seen as attached to land, the easement holder’s transfer of the dominant land automatically transfers the benefit of the appurtenant easement to the grantee. The land that is burdened by an easement is the **servient tenement (or property)**. The burden is transferred if the original servient owner transfers land to a new servient owner. (The new servient owner is subject to easement unless they are a Bona Fide Purchaser and thus was without any notice of easement.)

There are different types of easement. An **appurtenant easement** benefits the holder of the easement in her use of a specific parcel of land (the dominant estate, which is the property that benefits from the easement and to which the easement attaches [or is “appurtenant” to]). As the Supreme Court of New Jersey notes in *Village of Ridgewood v. Bolger Foundation* (1986), an appurtenant easement increases the value of the dominant estate and cannot exist separate from it. Appurtenant easements pass on to subsequent owners when the parcel is transferred. An **easement in gross** is not connected to easement holder’s use of any particular parcel of land; it is personal to the holder (e.g., the right to hunt foxes on land, right to place advertisements on property). Rights or restrictions in gross only benefit or burden a particular person. The modern trend is to allow the transfer of an easement in gross unless the parties had a contrary intent.

An affirmative easement allows holder to perform an act on servient land; a negative easement allows the holder to prevent servient owner from performing an act on the servient land.  Common negative easements include those for light, air, to prevent blocking view of dominant owner, to prevent excavating that might compromise support of a neighboring structure, and a conservation easement (preventing development).

An easement can be created by (1) an express grant (requires a writing) or (2) by operation of law. An easement by operation of law can be implied by (a) prior use; (b) necessity; (c) prescription (similar to adverse possession); or (d) estoppel.

---

**Express easement**

An **(1) express easement** must be (i) voluntarily created in a (ii) writing by servient owner either by (iii-a) grant to dominant owner (easement holder) or by (iii-b) reservation when dominant owner conveys portion of a larger parcel to a different owner but retains/reserves an easement over the servient (conveyed) property. To be complete, an express easement must (a) identify the parties; (b) describe the servient land and dominant land, if any (if the easement is in gross there is no dominant land); (c) describe exact location of easement on servient land; and (4) state the purpose for which the easement may be used.

---

**Easements by operation of law**

**Easement implied by prior use**

For a court to find that there is an **easement implied by prior use**, there must be (i) single ownership of dominant and servient parcels; (ii) conveyance or other transfer separating that ownership; (iii) before the conveyance dividing owner’s unified title, owner of parcel used one part of the unified parcel for the benefit of another part of it; (iv) before the conveyance, owner’s use was apparent and obvious, continuous, and permanent; (v) circumstances at the time of the severance of title indicate that original owner intended to give grantee an easement across what remained of owner’s land and (vi) claimed easement is necessary and beneficial to the enjoyment of the parcel conveyed or retained by the grantor. *Emanuel v. Hernandez* (Emanuel asserted that an easement implied by prior use authorized use of a driveway partly located on adjoining owner’s property; the two parcels were originally owned by one person).

(Easement is justified by the presumed intent of the parties, so no compensation is required to be paid to servient owner.)

In *Emanuel v. Hernandez*, the court held that evidence of the prior use element was lacking because plaintiff did not establish that owner of the original united parcel (before transferring part of it) made an apparent, obvious, continuous, permanent use of the part of the property he retained for the benefit of the part he conveyed to establish that current use of the driveway was implied by owner’s pre-existing use.

---

**Easement by necessity**

For a court to find that there is an **easement by necessity**, there must be (i) a division of property originally held by a single owner; and (ii) this division resulted in creating a landlocked parcel. In this situation, (iii) the owner of the servient estate is entitled to select route of easement by necessity, so long as it is reasonable; and (iv) easement remains in effect as long as necessity exists. (v) Easement will not arise if this would contradict affirmative showing of actual intent of the parties not to provide access rights. Under the majority rule and Restatement (Third) of Property, the standard for necessity is reasonable necessity, that is, beneficial or convenient for the use of the dominant parcel, but not absolutely necessary, which is a standard even more favorable to the easement holder than the standard in Berge. *Berge v. State of Vermont* (original owner conveyed part of property to State for wildlife preserve; parcel she held and later conveyed to another was landlocked but bordered a lake on one side)

(Easement is justified by the presumed intent of the parties, so no compensation is required to be paid to servient owner.)

In *Berge v. State of Vermont*, the court held that without use of road across state land, property owner would have no reasonably consistent, practical means of reaching his property if relying solely on water access to property, given vicissitudes of weather, etc.; today’s standards compel the conclusion that access to navigable water is generally not legally sufficient, standing alone, to defeat a finding of necessity based on property being otherwise landlocked.

NOTE: reasonable necessity is essentially the same standard that applies under easement implied by prior use.

---

**Prescriptive easement**

For a court to find that there is a **prescriptive easement**, there must be (i) adverse easement-like limited use of another’s land rather than possession of the land; (ii) adverse use was continuous and uninterrupted (iii) for the requisite number of years (10 years in the O’Dell case); (iv) adverse use was actually known to owner of the land or (v) so open, notorious, and visible that a reasonable owner of the land would have noticed the use and reasonably identified (a) starting and end point and dimensions of land adversely used and (b) manner or purpose to which land was used. Adverse use generally means use of property as the owner herself would exercise, entirely disregarding the claims of others, asking permission from no one. A prescriptive easement may be used by more than one person, and thus exclusivity is not required. An easement is not a possessory estate; thus, for there to be an easement, actual possession is not required.[^5] no compensation is required to be paid to servient owner for an easement acquired by prescription. *O’Dell v. Stegall* (plaintiff claims prescriptive right to use gravel lane to access his property, relying on his own and predecessors’ use of the lane to access land that he now owned).

In *O’Dell v. Stegall*, the court held that claimant seeking to establish easement to use gravel road for ingress and ingress to his property did not meet burden of proof. Claimant wholly failed to show that the defendants owned the land upon which the gravel lane rests, and failed to show that the prior use of the gravel lane, by himself and his predecessors, for the statutory period of 10 years* was adverse, that is, in any way wrongful toward, or without the express or implied permission of, the owner of the servient estate. Presumably, O’Dell had to show tacking because he did not use the lane for the requisite 10 years. (Tacking allows the adverse possession periods of two or more successive occupants to be added together to meet the statutory period for possession, but only if the occupants are in privity of estate, that is, where one occupant transfers apparent rights in the property to a successor by a deed or will, which benefits the successor by providing some evidence of title (color of title).)

[^5]:The list of elements we get from *O’Dell v. Stegall* is similar but not identical to elements we learned for adverse possession. (Recall that adverse possession of land also includes the requirement of (1) exclusive possession and (2) actual possession of land in the same manner as a reasonable owner would possess it, given the land’s s character, location, and nature. Neither element applies to a showing of a prescriptive easement).

---

**Easement by estoppel**

There is an **easement by estoppel** when, for example, a servient owner orally grants and then takes back permission for the supposed easement holder to use land after the latter has relied to her detriment on use of land. Relying mainly on the Restatement of Servitudes, the court generally rules that if injustice can be avoided only by establishment of a servitude (easement), the owner or occupier of land is estopped to deny the existence of a servitude (easement) burdening the land when (i) the owner or occupier permitted another to use that land (ii) under circumstances in which it was reasonable to foresee that the user would (iii) substantially change position believing that the permission would not be revoked, and (iv) the user did substantially change position in reasonable reliance on that belief.

In *Kienzle v. Myers* (Court of Appeals of Ohio 2006), property owner Van Duyne orally agreed to allow adjoining property owner Bauer to run a sewer line through Van Duyne’s property and connect to the Van Duyne’s sewer trench, which in turn connected to a public sewer. Years later, Van Duyne’s successor in title reneges, which would require the easement holders, the Myers (Bauer’s successor in title) to incur expense to put in a separate sewer connection line. The court held that under these circumstances, the easement will arise by estoppel—servient owner (Van Duyne’s successor) would not be permitted to withdraw permission upon which the easement holder Bauer had reasonably relied, and on the basis of which she had substantially changed her position. But for Van Duyne’s acquiescence to Bauer’s use of her property, Bauer would have linked to the sewer wholly on her own property. Bauer’s decision to cross Van Duyne’s land constituted a change in position which placed her access to the public sewer out of her control, which disadvantaged Bauer.

Some courts refer to easement by estoppel as an irrevocable license. The elements of irrevocable license overlap significantly with those of easement by estoppel, where (1) landowner allows another to use land, creating a license; (2) licensee relied in good faith on the permission, usually by making physical improvement or incurring expense; and (3) the licensor knows or reasonably should expect this reliance will occur.

The rule from *Marcus Cable Assocs. v. Krohn* (Supreme Court of Texas 2002), is that an easement’s express terms, interpreted according to their generally accepted meaning, delineate the purposes for which the easement holder may use the property. Thus, if a particular purpose is not provided for in the grant, a use pursuing that purpose is not allowed.

Although the common law does allow some flexibility in determining an easement holder’s rights (the manner, frequency, and intensity of an easement’s use may change over time to accommodate technological development, under the Restatement (Third) of Property (Servitudes) § 4.10), an express easement encompasses only those technological developments that further the particular purpose for which the easement was granted. Further, despite public benefits of wide distribution of cable TV service, court may not adopt an easement interpretation based on public policy unless that interpretation is supported by the grant’s terms. And if a use does not serve the easement’s express purpose, it becomes an unauthorized presence on the land whether or not it results in any noticeable burden to the servient estate In *Marcus Cable Assocs. v. Krohn*, the court held that while cable television may utilize electrical impulses to transmit communications, as Marcus Cable claims, the granting language in Hill County Electric’s easement does not convey the right to use the property for purposes of transmitting communications. Cable television transmission is not a more technologically advanced method of delivering electricity.

---

**Termination of easements**

Under the **abandonment doctrine**, in addition to nonuse, acts by the owner of the dominant tenement must conclusively and unequivocally manifest either (i) a present intent to relinquish the easement or (ii) a purpose inconsistent with its future existence.

Example: Easement held abandoned when Railroad removed all of the railroad equipment, including switches and tracks, from the portion of the right-of-way running over the servient parcels of land, and, consistent with this, no move had been made to reinstitute service over the line, or to undertake replacement of the removed tracks and other infrastructure necessary to return the line to service.

An express easement may terminate **by its own terms**.

Example: An easement created to “continue for 50 years” ends after that period.

**Condemnation of the servient land** also terminates the easement. In this event, the easement holder is entitled to just compensation.

Example: Government condemns (exercises power of **eminent domain** over) Tract A, owned by A, which is burdened by a right-of-way easement that neighboring property owner B has over Tract A, the servient land. When Government acquires Tract A, it also terminates the easement B held but B is entitled to just compensation for the loss of this non-possessory property interest.

In **termination by estoppel**, an easement ends if the servient owner substantially changes his position in reasonable reliance on the easement holder’s statement that the easement will not be used in the future.

Example: A (owner of servient property) is told by B, the easement holder, that B will no longer use the right- of-way over A’s land and A, in reliance on that statement, installs a swimming pool and adds a children’s play area with recreational equipment where the right–of-way had been. If B then insists on using the right-of-way, B’s easement will terminate on an estoppel theory.

For **termination by merger**, if one person obtains title to both the easement and the servient land, then the easement terminates under the doctrine of merger.

Example: Assume B holds an easement over Tract A, the servient land. B then buys Tract A from A, its owner. Once B acquires Tract A, B’s easement over the Tract and the Tract merge, and the easement terminates. Note: this will have meaning if B then conveys the land to C.  The easement can’t be revived.

Another way of terminating an easement is by **misuse**. In some jurisdictions, if the easement holder seriously misuses the easement, it may be ended through forfeiture.

Example: Assume B has the right to drive across adjoining property owner A’s property, to use it as a driveway. A’s land is the servient land and B’s is the dominant land. If B later purchased an adjacent lot and began to use his easement across A’s land to benefit the newly-purchased lot, then B has abused or misused his easement, and this will lead to its termination.

For **termination by prescription**, essentially the same standard for acquiring a prescriptive easement applies to ending an easement.

Example: if the servient owner blocks use of the easement in an open and notorious, adverse and hostile, and continuous manner for the prescriptive period, the easement ends.

An easement can be terminated by **release**. The easement holder B may release the easement to the servient owner A by executing and delivering a writing that complies with the Statute of Frauds.

Example: B signs a writing stating that B no longer claims an interest in using the easement it holds over A’s land, sufficiently describes the easement and the servient land in the writing, and releases the easement to A.

## Co-tenancy

Concurrent estates in land are **tenancy in common** and **joint tenancy**. The third concurrent estate, **tenancy by the entirety**, is limited to married couples.                    

A co-owner of concurrent estate in land is known as a co-tenant. Each co-tenant has right to use and enjoy the entire parcel of land (unity of possession). At the same time, each co-owner under either of these two estates owns a fractional share of the property at issue.

**Tenancy in common (TIC)**

Granting language: If Owner conveys Greenacre “to Alma and Bea,” this creates a presumptive tenancy in common.

In a tenancy in common, the shares of each grantee may or may not be equal. Each may transfer their interest to another person; the interest is freely alienable, devisable, and descendible. Finally, each has the right to use and possess the whole parcel, even if their fractional interest is smaller than the interests of other co-tenants.

Example:  Owner conveys Redacre to “Alma, Bea, and Cecily as tenants in common,” and Bea then conveys her interest to Alma. Alma and Cecily are tenants in common; Alma now holds a 2/3 interest, and Cecily has the remaining 1/3 interest. Cecily with a 1/3 interest has as much right as Alma with a 2/3 interest to use and enjoy the entire property. But when the property is sold, the proceeds will be divided according to their proportionate shares.

**Joint Tenancy (JT)**

Granting language: Owner conveys Greenacre “to Alma and Bea as joint tenants with right of survivorship.” In most jurisdictions, this creates a joint tenancy.

Like tenants in common, joint tenants have an undivided right to use and possess the whole property. But each joint tenant also has a right of survivorship. When Alma dies, Alma’s interest in the estate is removed, and Bea automatically becomes the sole owner of Greenacre. Because of the right of survivorship, a joint tenancy interest is neither devisable nor descendible. At common law and in some jurisdictions today, a joint tenancy is created only when the four unities of time, title, interest, and possession are present.

(1) For the unity of **time** to be present, all joint tenants must acquire their interests at the same time. (cannot acquire interests on different days). (2) For the unity of **title** to be present, all joint tenants must acquire title by the same instrument. (If they receive their interests by different deeds, the unity of title is missing). (3) For the unity of **interest** to be present, all joint tenants must must have the same shares in the estate, equal in size and duration. (If Alma receives an undivided 2/3 interest and Bea an undivided 1/3 interest, there is no unity of interest). (4) For the unity of **possession** to be present, all joint tenants must must have an equal right to possess, use, and enjoy the whole property. If any of the 4 unities is missing, a tenancy in common - instead of a joint tenancy - is created.

Example: Oscar conveys a 1/2 interest to Alice one day, and the next day conveys a 3/8 interest to Betty and a 1/8 interest to Carla. Does Oscar create a joint tenancy? No. The unities of time (property interest conveyed on different days), title (interest created by different deeds) and interest (shares in property are not equal) are missing; Alice, Betty, and Carla are tenants in common.

**Unities that once existed can be lost**. If one joint tenant transfers her interest, the joint tenancy is severed. **The transfer breaks the unities of time and title**; the right of survivorship is destroyed; and the grantee becomes a tenant in common with the other concurrent owners.

Example: Alma, Bea, and Cecily are joint tenants, each with a 1/3 interest, and Alma sells her interest to Dustin. Dustin has an undivided 1/3 interest as a tenant in common with Bea and Cecily; between themselves, Bea and Cecily remain joint tenants with a right of survivorship. If Dustin now dies, his tenancy in common interest will go to his devisees or heirs; but if Bea dies, her interest in the joint tenancy is removed, and Cecily with right of survivorship now has an undivided 2/3 interest, consisting of Cecily’s original share and Bea’s share.

When an instrument granting an interest does not clearly create a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common, many states construe an instrument to presumptively create a tenancy in common rather than a joint tenancy, if the intention to create a joint tenancy is not clear. However, even without the actual use of the words “joint tenancy," if from the four corners of an instrument a court can interpret the intention of the grantor or testator as creating a survivorship estate, the court will deem the estate to be a joint tenancy with the right of survivorship. The modern trend is to consider evidence of grantor’s intent, even if not stated in deed, as in NY.

**Tenancy by the Entirety**

A **tenancy by the entirety** is created if Oscar conveys Greenacre “to Allen and Betty as tenants by the entirety.” Like a joint tenant, each tenant by the entirety has an undivided right to use and possess the whole property and a right of survivorship. But while a joint tenancy can be severed unilaterally by any joint tenant, a tenancy by the entirety can only be ended by death, divorce, or the agreement of both spouses. The common law viewed a husband and a wife as a unity. There were no individual parts to the tenancy that could be owned separately by either spouse. In most states that recognize this co-tenancy, neither spouse may transfer or encumber (e.g., mortgage) his or her interest. The principal benefit of tenancy by the entirety is that in many jurisdictions it allows the holders to partially shield their assets from creditors.

**Occupation of jointly owned property by one co-tenant**

If one co-tenant occupies jointly owned property and the other co-tenants do not, (1) co-tenants are obligated to pay their pro-rata share of operating and maintenance expenses of the property;  and on a sale of commonly owned property, a co-tenant who has paid less than their pro-rata share of operating and maintenance expenses must account to co-tenant who has contributed more than their pro-rata share; this is so even if the under-contributing co-tenant has been out of possession of the property. (2) BUT the fact that one tenant in common occupies the property and the other does not imposes no obligation on the occupying co-tenant to make any contribution for rental value to the latter in the absence of the occupying co-tenant’s (in-co-tenant) ouster of the non-occupying co-tenant. An ouster occurs when a co-tenant in possession refuses to allow another co-tenant to occupy the property, that is, excludes them. In this situation, the ousting co-tenant is acting as an adverse possessor, and the ousted co-tenant would have to go to court just as any other property owner would when there is evidence of adverse possession within the statutory period in the jurisdiction to avoid title to the ousted co-tenant’s share ripening in the adverse possessing co-tenant (assuming they meet all the elements of adverse possession). The out-co-tenant is not entitled to their pro rata share of the rental value, that is, what the rental could have been if the property had been rented out to a third party. (3) All tenants in common have a right to occupy all of the property (unity of possession) and if one chooses not to do so, the law concludes that the non-occupying co-tenant does not have the right to impose an “occupancy” charge on the other. (4) Without an agreement setting rights and responsibilities among the co-tenants, the default rules don’t account for the contextual factors that can make the rules unfair in application.

In *Ashley v. Bullock* (Utah App 2013), the court held that once Bates survived the other joint tenant, at that point the Writing had not expired or been repudiated, and Bates had not yet been required to convey title. Therefore, the Writing was no longer unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds and court affirmed trial court ruling that the Bullocks had purchased the property. The court based its holding on the rules that (1) Under Utah law, when real property is held in joint tenancy, the signature of both owners is necessary to satisfy the Utah Statute of Frauds. (Here, Harris did not execute the Writing and therefore, no enforceable contract was formed in 1976 between Bates and the Bullocks). (2) When a joint tenant conveys “his interest therein by a valid deed,” he “ ‘severs and terminates the joint tenancy by the creation of a tenancy in common.’” But such a conveyance by valid deed does not convey the entire property because a joint tenant may not “dispose of more than his own interest in joint tenancy property, [in this case]  one-half thereof.” Id. (The Writing in this case indicates that Bates purported to contract to sell the entire property.). (3) Harris's interest passed to Bates, thereby giving him sole ownership of the Property. Although the contract was unenforceable when originally signed, Bates's acquisition of full title “revived” it because Harris's signature was no longer necessary to satisfy the Statute of Frauds and the Writing had not been repudiated in the meantime. **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Generally “a seller may make a valid contract to sell property, though the seller has no legal title to the property, as long as the seller has title when the time to convey arrives.”

**Statute of frauds**

To comply with the Statute of Frauds, there must typically be a writing including (i) names of the parties; (ii) adequate identification of the property; (iii) nature of interest to be transferred; (iv) price; and (v) signature of party to be charged (party against whom contract is to be enforced). No particular form of signature is generally required so long as there is reliable evidence that the person intended to authenticate the writing.

**Termination of co-tenancy by tenant in common or joint tenant (other than by severance)**

To terminate a co-tenancy, any tenant in common or joint tenant has the right to sue for partition of the property. A partition judgment ends the co-tenancy and distributes its assets. In such an action, the judge can either (1) physically divide the property between co-tenants (partition in kind) or (2) order the property to be sold and the proceeds divided.

In *Ark Land Co. v. Harper* (Supreme Court of Appeals of W. Virginia), the court followed the rule that partition means the division of the land held in co-tenancy into the co-tenants’ respective fractional shares. If the land cannot be fairly divided, then the entire estate may be sold and the proceeds appropriately divided.

**Partition in kind** is the preferred method of partition because it leaves co-tenants holding the same estates as before and does not force a sale on unwilling co-tenants. In *Ark Land*, the court noted that the laws in all jurisdictions “appear to ... provide a presumption of severance of common ownership in real property by partition in-kind[.]” The *Ark Land* court goes on to say that, in addition to economic value of property, evidence of longstanding ownership, coupled with sentimental or emotional interests in the property, may also be considered in deciding whether the interests of the party opposing the sale will be prejudiced by the property’s sale. NOTE: This is sometimes referred to as the “totality of the circumstances” approach but it is considered a minority approach. Most courts actually focus on maximizing economic value in determining whether partition should be in kind or by sale.

Takeaway: in analyzing a problem of this sort, you’d start with the presumption that appears in most statutes in favor of partition in kind, but note that factors included in these statutes are often applied in a way that concludes that sale is more feasible.     

In *Carr v. Dekking* (Wash. App. 1988), the court ruled that each tenant in common of real property may use, benefit, and possess the entire property subject only to the equal rights of co-tenants, and held that non-joining co-tenant is not entitled to eject lessee of other co-tenant from the property. The proper remedy is partition and until that occurs, lessee is entitled to farm the land under the lease. Non-joining co-tenant is entitled to the benefit of the other co-tenant-lessee lease terms, at his election, until a partition of the property occurs.

**Lease of co-tenant's interest**

A co-tenant may lawfully lease their own interest in the common property to another without the consent of the other co-tenant and without the other co-tenant joining in the lease. The lessee "steps into the shoes" of the leasing co-tenant and becomes a tenant in common with the other owners (co-tenants) for the duration of the lease. The Non-joining co-tenant is not bound by this lease of the common property to third persons. A Non-joining co-tenant may not demand exclusive possession as against the lessee, but may only demand to be let into co-possession. Alternatively, the non-joining co-tenant would seek partition.

**Rights and responsibilities of co-tenants**

- Right to contribution (reimbursement) or action for waste during co-tenancy. Co-tenant has right to receive reimbursement for paying operating expenses in excess of their pro-rata share. In some states, co-tenant who pays for needed repairs has right to contribution from other co-tenant(s) if notice is given of need for repair. A co-tenant may bring action for waste against other co-tenant.
- Rights to credits that may be recouped at an accounting or partition sale. Co-tenant has right to share of rents or profits generated by property, including profits from extracting resources such as minerals or timber. Co-tenant who pays for needed repairs and hasn’t been otherwise reimbursed will receive a credit for these costs in an accounting or partition action. Co-tenant who improves the property receives a credit equal to the increased market value produced by the improvement in an accounting action or a partition action. Co-tenant in exclusive possession is not liable to other co-tenant(s) for pro-rata share of fair rental value unless this co-tenant ousted other co-tenant(s).
