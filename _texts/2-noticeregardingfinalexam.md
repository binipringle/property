Final exam is timed and open book, scheduled for Monday, May 9, from  6:15-10:15 p.m. All students may take the final remotely during that time frame via TWEN.

The final will cover the following classes/topics:

- Real estate transactions (class #s 18-20)
- Easements (class #s 23-24)
- Cotenancy (class #s 13-14)
- Leaseholds (class #s 15-17)
- Mortgages (class #s 21-22)
- Zoning (class # 26)

Of these topics, the essays will be drawn from the following:

- Real estate transactions
- Easements
- Cotenancy

Classes not covered in the final: class #s 1-12, and class # 25*

Note that a few topics run across multiple doctrines, e.g., notice, tacking, and if these topics are discussed in the covered classes/topics flagged here, even if they originated in a non-covered class, they could also potentially be included in the final.
