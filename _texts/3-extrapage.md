## Standing

To have standing, a plaintiff must have a sufficient stake in the lawsuit to **(1) give rise to an Article III "case or controversy"** and **(2) satisfy the Supreme Court’s judge-made "prudential limitations."** (only one prudential limit remains after *Lexmark*). Congress may override prudential limitations by statute, but may not override Article III case or controversy limits; i.e., Congress may not authorize lawsuits by parties that do not satisfy the Article III case or controversy requirements (e.g., compare *Lujan* with *Akins*). **Underlying policies** are **adverse presentation of issues** (courts want cases to be vigorously litigated [this ensures fairness]); **autonomy** (favors placing litigation of rights in the hands of those most affected) and **additional separation of powers and federalism considerations**.

- {:.indent-0}**Allen v. Wright (1984)**:
- {:.indent-2}Background: IRS denies tax-exempt status to racially discriminatory private schools, and established guidelines and procedures for determining whether a school is racially nondiscriminatory. Private schools deemed racially discriminatory are not eligible to receive tax deductible charitable contributions. Parents of African-American children brought a class action lawsuit against IRS in federal district court, contending that IRS guidelines and procedures were insufficient and allowed white parents to avoid integration by sending children to private schools and deducting charitable contributions, thereby making it harder for Black children to attend integrated schools. W. Wayne Allen was defendant in his official capacity as chairman of the board of Briarcrest Christian School, Memphis. The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that respondents lacked standing. Court of Appeals reversed. U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari.
- {:.indent-2}Alleged injuries: (1) Direct harm by government financial aid (through allowing tax deductions for donations) to discriminatory schools. This was argued to be a stigmatic injury because of the appearance of government approval for discrimination against blacks. (2) Tax exemptions for discriminatory schools impaired the ability of blacks to force desegregation of public schools, because white parents would simply withdraw their children from public schools and place them in discriminatory private schools.
- {:.indent-2}Issue: Whether the plaintiffs had standing to bring the lawsuit.
- {:.indent-2}Holding/rule: Citizens do not have standing to sue a federal government agency based on the influence that the agency's determinations might have on third parties. "In essence the question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues. Standing doctrine embraces... the general prohibition on a litigant's raising another person's legal rights, the rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches, and the requirement that a plaintiff's complaint fall within the zone of interests  to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question." The requirement of standing, however, has a core component derived directly from the Constitution. A plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to defendant’s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief."" **Zone of interests test is no longer part of standing analysis after 2014, but relates instead to whether a particular statute confers a right of action on the plaintiff.**[^2]
- {:.indent-2}Dissents: Justice Brennan wrote a dissenting opinion complaining that the use of separation of powers is a truism. He opined that the injury of the children's opportunities was enough to grant standing to sue. Justice Stevens wrote that the allegation really is that the government is subsidizing white flight, which is sufficient to allow standing – the harm (lack of desegregated schools) was traceable to government conduct. Stevens also asserted that standing has nothing to do with separation of powers.

[^2]:In *Lexmark v. Static Controls* (2014), the Supreme Court held that zone-of-interest is no longer to be considered part of standing analysis, but relates instead to whether a particular statute confers a right of action on the plaintiff.  The zone-of-interests test will appear as part of the standing rule statement in many pre-2014 judicial opinions; those rule statements are no longer correct.  

- {:.indent-0}**Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife (1992)**
- {:.indent-2}Issue: Whether the Endangered Species Act of 1973 applied to development projects in Aswan, Egypt and Mahaweli, Sri Lanka funded by the U.S., that could harm endangered species in  affected areas in the U.S..
- {:.indent-2}Rule: Plaintiffs must suffer a concrete, discernible injury - not a "conjectural or hypothetical one" — to have Article III standing to bring a suit against the U.S. government in federal court. It, in effect, made it more difficult for plaintiffs to challenge the actions of a government agency when the actions don't directly affect them.[2]
- {:.indent-2}Holding: Defenders of Wildlife lacked standing to challenge regulations jointly issued by the U.S. Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce, regarding the geographic area to which a particular section of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 applied.

- {:.indent-0}**Federal Election Commission v. Akins (1998)**
- {:.indent-2}Background: Akins asked the Federal Elections Commission ("FEC") to determine that an organization called the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ("AIPAC") was a "political committee" subject to certain regulations and reporting requirements under the Federal Election Campaign Act, because AIPAC had crossed certain spending thresholds. The FEC determined that AIPAC had indeed crossed those thresholds, but still did not require it to make the required reports because the organization was issue-oriented, not campaign-related. District Court granted summary judgment for FEC; Court of Appeals panel affirmed but Court of Appeals en banc reversed. The government sought certiorari and challenged plaintiff's standing on the grounds that plaintiffs had suffered no 'injury in fact'; any injury was not fairly traceable to the FEC decision; and a decision in favor of the plaintiffs would not redress their injury.
- {:.indent-2}Issue: Whether the plaintiffs suffered an injury in fact sufficient to establish standing.
- {:.indent-2}Holding/Rule: The Court (Justice Breyer) held that Congress has, by statute, allowed "any party aggrieved by an order of the Commission" to file a suit, which is a broad grant; not getting the requested information is an "injury in fact" just like the denial of any other information which is statutorily required to be provided to citizens by the government. The grievance is a "generalized grievance," but the harm is concrete enough to overcome this, and the harm is fairly traceable to the FEC – even though the FEC may find other grounds not to make AIPAC provide the info.
- {:.indent-2}**Zone of interests test**: The Court distinguished this case from lawsuits where an individual seeks relief based on mere taxpayer standing - an insufficient ground for standing to sue. It instead employed a "zone of interests test," asking whether the injury asserted fell into the zone of interests protected by the statute.
- {:.indent-2}Outcome for plaintiff: Case was remanded to the FEC to review its definition of 'members.' FEC produced new guidelines which would not require a new legal precedent. The plaintiffs were bitterly disappointed and tried to have case re-opened because wanted AIPAC to be considered political actin committee but in 2010 a Federal court in D.C. ruled that the lawsuit had no merit as electoral law and it was officially and finally dismissed.
- {:.indent-2}Dissent: Justice Scalia asserted that the fact the statute differentiated between 'any person' (in defining the class of persons who could file a complaint with the FEC over a violation) and 'any party aggrieved' (in defining the class of persons who could bring suit in federal court over the FEC's decision on the complaint) demonstrated the limiting force of the latter provision—anyone could file a complaint with the FEC if they believed a violation had occurred, but only parties who had actually been aggrieved (suffered a particularized injury) as a result of the FEC's decision on the complaint could sue.

- {:.indent-0}**Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins (2016)**
- {:.indent-2}Issue: Whether the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit properly determined whether the plaintiff suffered an "injury-in-fact" when analyzing whether he had standing.
- {:.indent-2}Background: Spokeo operates a .com website featuring a "people search engine" with which its users can obtain in-depth consumer reports on individual persons. In 2010, a class action law firm sued Spokeo alleging violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) because profiles of people had been misreported. In 2011, the court dismissed the initial complaint for not alleging "any actual or imminent harm." Robins amended complaint to allege employment, stress and anxiety injuries. In 2011, Judge Wright found Robins had alleged a valid injury-in-fact but then reversed himself and dismissed the case for lack of standing after Spokeo filed for an appeal. In 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the dismissal and remanded the case, finding that Robins had alleged injuries sufficient to establish standing because FCRA protected individual rather than collective rights and Robins was suing for a violation of his own statutory rights. U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari.
- {:.indent-2}Holding/Rule: (Justice Alito) The circuit below had failed to establish that Robins had standing to file the lawsuit under Article Three of the Constitution. The Court reasoned that the Case or Controversy Clause requires any plaintiff to allege an injury-in-fact that is "concrete and particularized". Here, although the Ninth Circuit identified particular harms to Robins, it erred by not also determining that those harms were "concrete". Although intangible harms such as risk can be concrete, the Court clarified, "bare procedural violations" cannot. The Court remanded and took "no position as to whether the Ninth Circuit’s ultimate conclusion— that Robins adequately alleged an injury in fact— was correct."
- {:.indent-2}Dissent: Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justice Sotomayor, dissented. Justice Ginsburg wrote that she agreed with much of the Court’s opinion but saw "no utility" in remanding the case back to the Ninth Circuit. Justice Ginsburg saw the many inaccuracies published by Spokeo as concretely harming Robins and, as such, she would have simply affirmed.

- {:.indent-0}**City of Los Angeles v. Lyons (1983)**
- {:.indent-2}Background: In 1976, Adolph Lyons was stopped by four white LAPD officers for driving with a broken tail light. The unarmed 24-year-old was ordered to leave his vehicle by officers with guns drawn and to spread his legs and put his hands on top of his head. After being frisked, Lyons put his hands down, and an officer put him in a chokehold until he lost consciousness. Lyons woke up lying face down in the road with soiled underwear and blood and dirt in his mouth. The officers gave him a traffic citation and sent him on his way. Seven years later, Lyons sought compensatory damages for the chokehold and declaratory and injunctive relief against the LAPD's chokehold policy.
- {:.indent-2}Holding: Lyons failed to allege a sufficiently-plausible threat of future injury to have standing to seek an injunction. Lyons had standing for his damages action since it was retrospective and the injury was concrete and particular. The decision helped to establish the principle that a plaintiff must meet a standing requirement for each form of relief sought.

### Article III case or controversy requirement

(1) Injury; (2) Causation; (3) Redressability

---

### (1) Injury

Injury in fact: plaintiff must show an “injury” that is (a) “concrete” and “particularized” (as opposed to “abstract” and “undifferentiated”); and (b) “actual” or “imminent” (as opposed to “speculative” or “remote”.)

*What types of harm (harms to what interests) may constitute “injury”? What is a “concrete” injury, as opposed to an “abstract” one?  Note especially the debate in Akins between Breyer (for the Court) and Scalia (in dissent).  Why was plaintiff’s injury in Akins “concrete” but the injury alleged in Lujan under the Endangered Species Act’s “citizen-suit” provision not “concrete”?*

- {:.indent-0}An injury is a “concrete injury" if it is:
- {:.indent-2}(1) “tangible” (physical, financial, economic).
- {:.indent-2}(2) “intangible” injuries may be concrete if they
- {:.indent-5}(a) abridge constitutional rights (free speech, free exercise, privacy, etc);
- {:.indent-5}(b) infringe upon other “intangible” interests previously recognized by the Court (environmental, aesthetic, etc.);
- {:.indent-5}(c) are historically recognized injuries (Alito gives the example of “qui tam” actions (bounty actions)[^3] which American and English courts have entertained for centuries (see e.g. the excerpt from Marvin v. Trout, 199 U.S. 212 (1906), discussed in class – and quoted on the class scroll.)
- {:.indent-5}(d) Congress may create statutory rights the invasion of which constitute “concrete injury” (see Kennedy’s Lujan concurrence) However, as the Court stated in Spokeo, a plaintiff does not “automatically” satisfy the injury requirement “whenever a statute grants a person a statutory right and purports to authorize that person to sue to vindicate that right.”  The Court will decide for itself whether violation of the statutory interest causes a “concrete” injury.  Violation of a statutorily-created “procedural right” counts as concrete injury if that procedural violation increases “the risk of real harm” to the plaintiff or otherwise affects the plaintiff’s concrete interests. (For example, see the Spokeo majority’s discussion of what Robins would have to allege to satisfy this requirement – and Ginsberg’s dissent arguing that plaintiff had already made the requisite allegations.)  A “bare procedural violation” without more (i.e., absent any impact some “actual,” “concrete” interest of the plaintiff) does not count as a “concrete injury.”

[^3]:Legal Definition of qui tam action: an action that is brought by a person on behalf of a government against a party alleged to have violated a statute especially against defrauding the government through false claims and that provides for part of a penalty to go to the person bringing the action.

**“Particularized” injury**: Justices all seem to agree that a violation of voting rights affecting an entire population would cause each individual voter a “particularized” injury. “Widely shared harms” (even harms that may extend to the public at large) may nevertheless be “particularized” and count as Article III injury if they are “concrete” and not “abstract.”  For example, wholesale violation of an individual constitutional right (e.g., imposition of a poll tax in violation of the 24th Amendment) would harm all or most citizens, and each of them would have an Article III injury. Each person’s injury would be “particularized”, even though millions of people suffer exactly the same harm.  See discussion in *Akins*.

**“Generalized grievances”**: There is some uncertainty about the extent to which the ban on generalized grievances is a component of the Article III injury requirement or should be considered a non-constitutional “prudential limitation” on standing, as the Court in Allen v. Wright and many earlier cases listed it. (The Court in Akins noted this uncertainty, but declined to resolve it.)   But this much seems settled: the ban on generalized grievances, defined narrowly as “suits ‘claiming only harm to [the plaintiff's] and every citizen's interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large’”, must now be considered an Article III constitutional limitation on standing. Note that a “generalized grievance” as defined above involves only “abstract” harm.[^4]

[^4]:What rules emerge from Lujan and Kennedy’s concurrence in that case; from Akins; and from the explanation of “concrete” injury in Spokeo?). Consider these hypos, some of which we discussed in class. Why does the Freedom of Information Act’s authorization of private suits comport with Art. III? (Assume that it does!)  Could Congress grant “every citizen” a “right” to “a federal government that obeys the Constitution” and authorize federal lawsuits by any citizen who alleges her right has been abridged?  (Why not?) Could Congress confer upon each citizen a “right to clean air” and authorize citizens to bring federal suits against any entity (public or private) that acts in ways that abridge that right (including, e.g., governmental failure to enforce the Clean Air Act properly)?  Do you think it matters -- for purposes of the Supreme Court's standing analysis -- whether the "citizen suits" are brought against private parties or against the government? (Why?)  Note the dictum in the Lexmark footnote defining a set of “generalized grievances” that do not satisfy Art III’s “injury” requirement. (Congress may not authorize lawsuits that assert only a “generalized grievance” as narrowly defined in Lexmark.

**Threatened injury** can give rise to standing if it is “imminent” and not merely “speculative” or “conjectural”.[^5]

[^5]:How imminent or likely to occur must a threatened injury be? What does Clapper say about this?  Note the concession in footnote 5 that the "certainly imminent" standard may not always apply.  Later cases, including Driehaus, alternatively use “significant risk” as the standard for determining whether a threatened injury gives rise to an Art. III case or controversy.  Compare Justice Breyer's explanation in his Clapper dissent.  What role does the subject-matter of the case – here foreign affairs/intelligence gathering – play in how the Court conducts the standing inquiry?

---

### (2) Causation

The injury must be "fairly traceable" to challenged action.

Note the issue of multiple links in the causal chain, especially where some links in the chain involve actions of third parties not before the court (e.g. Allen v. Wright; Linda R.S.; Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization).  Multiple links in the causal chain between the challenged action and the injury are not necessarily fatal, but the Court will scrutinize such chains to determine if the causal links are strong enough, especially where the suit seeks an order requiring the government to enforce laws against third parties (see e.g., Allen and Lujan, where the Court invoked separation of powers and Art. II §3 “take care clause” arguments as justification for applying the causation requirement more strictly).   Note that the court’s characterization of the injury may affect the length of the causal chain and may alter the causation analysis (recall class discussion of Linda R.S. and Bakke.)

---

### (3) Redressability

An award of relief to the plaintiff must be likely to redress (cure, mitigate, compensate for) the Article III injury alleged, at least to some extent.  

Recall the discussion of redressability/causation in Akins where the Court held that plaintiffs satisfied those elements of standing despite the fact that a court order in plaintiffs’ favor might not ultimately redress plaintiffs’ injury (because the FEC retained discretion to excuse AIPAC from FECA’s public disclosure requirements).  Note also the discussion of redressability and "procedural rights" in Lujan footnote 7, making the same point.

- {:.indent-0}**Federal Election Commission v. Akins (1998)** (FEC claimed that American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) lacked prudential standing to bring suit because it was not a “political committee” and thus did not have to disclose its members, contributions, and expenditures, as was required of political committees.)
- {:.indent-2}Rule: Prudential standing is satisfied when the injury asserted arguably falls within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute in question.
- {:.indent-2}Issue: Is prudential standing satisfied when the injury asserted falls within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute in question?
- {:.indent-2}Holding and Reasoning (Breyer, J.): Yes. To establish constitutional standing, a party must establish that its injury is concrete, fairly traceable to the challenged action, and redressable. Prudential standing is satisfied when the injury asserted by a plaintiff arguably falls within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute in question. In the present case, the plaintiffs’ injury is that they were unable to obtain information about the AIPAC that was relevant to their evaluation of candidates for public office. Although this injury is widely shared, it is sufficiently concrete to meet the requirement under Article III of the U.S. Constitution because the injury is definite and directly related to voting. Furthermore, the injury is fairly traceable to the FEC’s decision because the decision directly deprived the plaintiffs of the information they sought. Finally, the injury falls within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the Act. The Act provides that “[a]ny person who believes a violation this Act . . . has occurred, may file a complaint with the [FEC].” Certainly, the plaintiffs believe a violation of the Act occurred, and under the terms of the Act itself, they have prudential standing. As a result of the foregoing, the plaintiffs have standing to bring this claim. The case is remanded to the FEC.
- {:.indent-0}Dissent (Scalia, J.): As the majority notes, the Act provides that “[a]ny person who believes a violation this Act . . . has occurred, may file a complaint with the [FEC]” and that “[a]ny party aggrieved by an order of the [FEC] dismissing a complaint filed by such party . . . may file a petition” in district court. The distinction between “person” in the former clause and “aggrieved party” in the latter is significant, but the majority’s decision removes any limiting authority that the latter clause had. The plaintiffs’ claimed injury is not lack of access to information; it is the FEC’s refusal to bring an enforcement action against a third party. Regardless, the plaintiffs assert a generalized grievance, applicable to “virtually the entire population,” that is best remedied through political, rather than judicial means.

### Prudential limitations

Non-constitutional, judge-made limitations on standing. Since these limitations are non-constitutional, they are not binding on Congress.  Congress may authorize federal suits by individuals who satisfy Article III case and controversy requirements, irrespective of any prudential limitation.  

- {:.indent-0}**Lexmark v. Static Controls (2014)**
- {:.indent-2}Rule: Supreme Court suggested (but has not yet held) that prudential limitations ordinarily should not prevent federal adjudication of claims that meet the Article III case and controversy requirements.  The Court’s dictum leaves the status of standing doctrine in some doubt.
- {:.indent-2}Reasoning: No "generalized grievances:" the Court has said that the federal judiciary should decline on prudential grounds to adjudicate “generalized grievances shared in substantially equal measure by all or a large class of citizens."" (see also Akins; Richardson; Schlesinger). As noted above, the ban on generalized grievances is an Article III constitutional limitation on standing, not a prudential limitation. To the extent that the ban on “generalized grievances” described in earlier cases had a broader scope than defined above, it is unclear whether it survives as a prudential limitation (or may in a later case be deemed part of the Art. III injury test.)  
- {:.indent-0}Note: For our purposes, assume that the ban on “generalized grievances” now exists only in its narrow version and only as part of the Article III injury requirement.  So **as of now, there is only one established “prudential limitation” – the ban on assertion of third party rights.**

### Exceptions

(a) To the extent that there is anything left of the “generalized grievance” concept as a prudential limitation, Congress can override this limitation (subject to the standards described in Akins and Spokeo and in the Kennedy concurrence in Lujan.)

(b) *Flast v. Cohen*:  taxpayers have standing to challenge an exercise of Congress’s Article I, sec. 8 taxing and spending power as violative of First Amendment Establishment Clause. (Note that *Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc.* (2007) held that taxpayers have no standing to challenge executive branch expenditures as violative of the Establishment Clause.)  

(c) **General bar against plaintiff assertion of the legal rights of third parties not before the Court** (sometimes referred to as rule against jus (right) tertii (third party)). Justification for this limitation is the idea that the party whose rights are most directly at stake ordinarily should have responsibility and control over litigation of those rights. Therefore, courts should only allow the assertion of a third party’s rights by litigants whose interests are **very closely aligned with the right-holder’s**, and who can be trusted to **advocate vigorously** for the third-part’s rights.

### Exceptions to exceptions

(a) Congressional override [NB: plaintiff must always meet Article III requirements.]

(b) Where “enforcement of the challenged restriction against the litigant would result indirectly in the violation of third parties’ rights.” For example, enforcement of the alcohol sales restriction against the Plaintiff bar owner in *Craig v. Boren* would result indirectly in the violation of the equal protection rights of the 18-20 year old men; or enforcement of criminal statutes prohibiting distributing contraceptives against the Plaintiff medical providers in Griswold would result in violation of their patients’ constitutional privacy and reproductive rights.

(c) Where the challenged statute, regulation, etc. would "preclude or otherwise adversely affect a relationship existing between the litigant and the persons whose rights are violated."  (e.g, the relationship between parochial schools and parents in Pierce v. Society of Sisters;  possibly the vendor-vendee relationship in Craig, or doctor-patient relationship in Griswold). Note that this exception overlaps with exception (b).

(d) Where there is otherwise a “close relationship” between the litigant and the third party who possesses the right, and “there is a hindrance to the possessor’s ability to protect his or her own interests.”  (E.g. Sessions v. Morales, 137 S. Ct. 1678, 1688-89 (2017).) [Nb: the overriding inquiry in assessing the applicability of exceptions (b), (c) or (d) is whether the plaintiff will vigorously advocate the rights of the third party; if the court concludes that the litigant may not be a vigorous advocate for the rights of the third party – or may have different interests from the third party – it will deny standing]. 		

(e)	Significance of *City of Los Angeles v. Lyons*: plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each element of relief; the fact that the defendant’s action injured an individual in the past does not necessarily give that individual standing to seek a prospective injunction.

## Eleventh Amendment State Sovereign Immunity Limitations on Federal Judicial Power

*The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.* Eleventh Amendment.

(a) The 11th Amendment limits (i) federal judicial power; and, (ii) as the Court has elaborated the doctrine, the 11A “presupposes” the existence of state sovereignty principles that limit congressional power to abrogate state sovereign immunity in federal court (Seminole) or in state court (Alden), and also (iii): immunizes state defendants from certain federal administrative proceedings initiated by private parties (Federal Maritime Comm’n). (b) State sovereign immunity ("11A immunity" or "SSI") applies only when a state is the defendant or the "real party in interest" on the defense side. SSI comes into play where the state, a state agency, a state official sued in official capacity, and/or other entities acting as an “arm of the state” are defendants " (see Handout 5, p. 3); there is no SSI if the defendant is a county, city, other political subdivision or local official (unless "arm-of-state"), or state officials sued in their individual capacities. (c) There is no SSI limitation (even if a state is the defendant) where the plaintiff is the United States (including agencies of the U.S.) or another state (cf. Art III, §2); cases involving any other plaintiff (including foreign states) subject to SSI limitations[^6].

**General rule:** State defendants (state, state agency, arm-of-state, state officials in official capacity) are immune from private suits (suits by plaintiffs other than the U.S. or another U.S. state) in any federal or state court or quasi-judicial federal administrative proceeding, unless the state has waived its immunity or Congress has validly abrogated it, or the “Ex Parte Young exception” applies.  

**Ex Parte Young exception:** Private plaintiffs may maintain a federal suit against (a) a state official in official capacity; (b) only for “prospective relief;” (c) on a federal law claim (but not on state law claims); (d) unless Congress has expressed an intent to foreclose Ex parte Young suit (see Seminole Tribe).

Schematic view of 11A impact, assuming (a) suit in federal court; (b) against a "state defendant" (see above); (c) commenced by plaintiffs other than the United States or another state; and (d) State has not waived and Congress has not validly abrogated State's sovereign immunity:

*Understand the theory of Ex Parte Young.  Clarify the impact of Seminole Tribe on the availability of Ex Parte Young actions against state officials.  What is the standard for determining whether Congress intended to foreclose an Ex Parte Young suit?*

**What counts as “prospective relief” allowable in Ex parte Young suit?**  Basic rule is that “relief necessary to halt an ongoing violation of federal law” -- and any "ancillary relief" (relief in aid of the primary relief, such as attorneys’ fees or notice to class members) -- is "prospective" relief permitted by the 11th amendment, even if the relief requires expenditures of state funds.   Relief not necessary to halt a present violation of federal law, but that serves only compensatory or deterrent interests, is "retrospective" relief and is not available through an Ex Parte Young suit.  What is the theoretical basis upon which the Supreme Court justifies drawing this line between permitted prospective relief and prohibited retrospective relief?

Examples:

Edelman: federal court order requiring state, from the date of the order forward, to obey federal law in administering the state’s public assistance program is "prospective" relief; the relief is "necessary to halt an ongoing violation of federal law" and is therefore not barred by the 11A.  By contrast, an order requiring the state to refund all the benefits it illegally withheld in the past is "retrospective" relief; this relief is not necessary to end a continuing violation of federal law, and since the relief would be paid for from the state treasury, it is barred by the 11A.

Milliken v. Bradley:  federal court order that Michigan fund a special education program to remedy the current effects of past de jure desegregation in the public schools, held to be "prospective" relief; current effects of past unconstitutional behavior said to be present constitutional violation; relief is therefore "necessary to halt an ongoing violation of federal law," even though it addresses harms caused by past unconstitutional state action.  

[^6]:**Article III, Section 2 clause 1. *The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls; to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction; to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party; to Controversies between two or more States; between a State and Citizens of another State, between Citizens of different States, between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.*

### Abrogation

Congress may "abrogate" (remove, override) a state’s SSI if:

(a) Congress "unequivocally" expresses its intent to do so in the text of a statute.  Note: the normal rules of statutory construction do not apply here; the Court will not consider legislative history or resort to usual tools of statutory analysis, even though these may reveal a clear congressional intent to override the 11A (see Seminole Tribe); the statute need not use “magic words” (e.g., abrogation, 11th Amendment, sovereign immunity, etc.) but must make clear that it authorizes private suits against a state defendant.

(b) Congress has enacted the statute in the exercise of a constitutional power that the Court finds authorizes nullification of SSI. Thus far, the Court has held that Congress has the authority to abrogate SSI under section 5 of the 14th amendment and has suggested in Seminole Tribe and Alden that no Article I power gives Congress the authority to abrogate.  (Why?)  However, in Katz (2006) the Court held that the bankruptcy clause of Article I §8 itself represents a surrender of states’ state sovereign immunity in certain bankruptcy proceedings.

If Congress "abrogates" a state’s 11A immunity/SSI, the state may be sued to the extent of the abrogation in the same manner as any other defendant.  (Abrogation is not "all or nothing."  For instance Congress might decide to authorize suits only against certain state defendants and/or only for some specified relief -- as it did in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.)

**Civil Rights Enforcement Power** will NOT be tested **but we are expected to know that Congress may abrogate state sovereign immunity through a valid exercise of the civil rights power**. Sources: Sec. 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment; Sec. 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment; Sec. 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court has held that section 5 grants Congress a broad power -- akin to its “necessary and proper” power -- to select the means to carry out the goals of the 14th amendment.  A statute is “appropriate legislation” under section 5 of the 14th amendment if it is “plainly adapted” to securing due process or equal protection and is “not prohibited by, but is consistent with the letter and spirit of the Constitution.”  Congress may legislate to "remedy, prevent or deter" violations of 14th amendment rights, and it may choose to prohibit conduct that is not itself unconstitutional as the means of remedying, preventing or deterring constitutional violations.  However, after Boerne, there must be a “congruence and proportionality” between the 14th amendment injury Congress seeks to deter or remedy and the means Congress adopts to achieve that end.   (Understand why the Court concluded that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act failed this "congruence and proportionality" test.) **Kimel** refines the test for determining whether Congress has acted within its section 5 power. **Shelby County** invalidates section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.

### The meaning of Alden

States have a constitutional immunity from federal law claims brought by individuals in the state’s own courts.  Congress may not abrogate this immunity unless exercising its power under §5 of the 14th amendment (or, presumably, under other powers conferred on Congress at the expense of state autonomy after adoption of the 11th amendment).  Alden holds, in essence, that the same state sovereign immunity rules applicable in federal court apply equally to private suits alleging federal claims against states in their own courts.

---

### Waiver

States may "waive" their 11A immunity, but the Court has set an extremely high threshold for finding waiver, and construes waivers narrowly. (As with abrogation, waiver is not "all or nothing."  A state that has waived its immunity may be sued only to the extent of the waiver, which be qualified, e.g., limited to certain forms of relief.)  General waivers of sovereign immunity by a state have been held insufficient to waive 11A immunity; the Supreme Court requires that the state expressly waive its immunity to suit in federal court in order for a federal action to go forward.  The Court will not imply waiver from a state’s participation in a federal program and agreement to obey federal standards, and the Court seems unwilling to find any constructive waiver of state sovereign immunity (e.g. Edelman) except where a State’s litigation actions amount to a consent to federal jurisdiction.  E.g., Lapides v. Bd. of Regents (2002) (implied waiver of SSI where state agency voluntarily removed a lawsuit from state court to federal court).  Congress may require states to waive their 11A immunity as a condition of receiving federal funds, and courts will enforce the waiver if Congress has set forth the condition in very clear terms. (This is in essence another “clear statement rule,” akin to the “clear statement rule” applied in the abrogation context.) (Cf. Pennhurst)

The meaning of Federal Maritime Comm’n:  states enjoy immunity from federal administrative proceedings that (a) closely resemble judicial proceedings and (b) are initiated by a private party.  What was the Court’s rationale for extending state sovereign immunity principles to administrative proceedings used by the federal executive to enforce federal law?  What elements of the administrative proceeding here led the majority to conclude that the proceedings were functionally indistinguishable from a judicial proceeding?  (Notice that the administrative law judge could not order any immediate relief against the state, but that did not alter the majority’s conclusion.  Why not?)  Can a federal agency subject states to any administrative processes or proceedings after Federal Maritime?

## Spending Power

[Spending power will not be tested on midterm **except to the extent that we discussed it in the context of state sovereign immunity:** you should know that Congress may use the spending power to induce States to ‘waive’ state sovereign immunity, for instance by making such a waiver a condition of state receipt of certain federal funds. (Congress must set forth the condition clearly in order for the Court to conclude that a state’s acceptance of federal funds works a waiver of immunity.)]  

Source: Article I, sec. 8, cl. 1.  Congress may tax and spend to pay the national debt, to provide for the common defense, and to advance the “general welfare” of the United States.

Scope:

"General welfare" of the U.S. is broader than the enumerated powers of Congress. (Butler).  Congress has wide, and perhaps unreviewable, authority to define the "general welfare" for which it may make appropriations. (Dole)

Congress may accomplish regulatory goals by imposing conditions on spending which require promises or contracts between the federal government and the recipient, whether the recipient is a private individual or a state. (Steward Machine).  The 10th amendment does not prevent Congress from using its spending power to influence or regulate areas of traditional state concern.

Congress may condition a state’s receipt of federal funds on the state’s agreement to abide by certain federal directives (including adopting federal policies, administering federal laws or programs and waiving state sovereign immunity); but the Court has announced that under some extreme circumstances, attaching conditions to federal funds may amount to coercion and therefore exceed the scope of the spending power. (South Dakota v. Dole).

Spending will be constitutional if (Dole):

1. the spending is designed to advance the general welfare of the U.S. (note: the Court gives Congress very great deference to determine what constitutes "the general welfare.");
2. the conditions attached to the receipt of federal funds are unambiguous, at least where the condition is imposed on federal grants to states;
3. the conditions are in some way "related" to the federal interest in the particular national projects or programs funded (e.g. if Congress conditioned a state's receipt of federal highway funds on the state's adoption of a federally specified kindergarten curriculum for public schools, that would raise an issue of relatedness);
4. the conditions do not require the recipient of the federal funds (at least if the recipient is a state) to violate some other constitutional provision, e.g. the bill of rights.

Q. NFIB v. Sebelius elaborated on (some would say altered) conditional spending doctrine, holding that Affordable Care Act impermissibly coerced states into expanding their federally-funded Medicaid programs. What is the Court's definition of "coercion"?  Does this coercion analysis ever apply if Congress simply offers states money to operate a program on condition that the state follow federal directives for how the program is to be operated?  Why did the Court try to distinguish “existing Medicaid” from “ACA Medicaid”?

**"Unconstitutional Conditions" doctrine** [this will not be tested on the midterm or the final, but you should be aware of it]: Under some circumstances, the Court has held that Congress may not condition an important benefit on the waiver of a constitutional right, or "penalize" the exercise of a constitutional right by withholding a benefit; this is known as the "unconstitutional conditions" doctrine.  The Court has scaled back this doctrine in recent years.  Recall cases discussed in class: James (welfare/4th amendment); Rust (medical assistance/1st amendment); Lyng v. UAW (food stamps/1st amendment).

## External Constraints on Congressional Powers

Note that implicit and explicit prohibitions in the original constitution’s text (e.g., Article I, section 9) and the Bill of Rights, including the subsequent Amendments, operate as a constraint on the exercise of all the powers of Congress.  How does the 10th amendment figure in this structure (is it an external constraint?)  What about the 11th amendment?

## Commerce Power

Source: [Article I, sec. 8, cl. 3](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-8); classic interpretation of the commerce clause appears in Gibbons v. Ogden.

The following principles governed the scope of the commerce power before Lopez and Morrison:

1. The "significant" or "substantial" effects test:  Congress can regulate any activity that substantially affects interstate commerce, even if the regulated activity is not itself either "interstate" or "commerce."  (E.g. NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin; Heart of Atlanta; McClung).

2. The "aggregate" or "cumulative effect" rule:  Congress can regulate activities that, considered one by one, would have no effect on interstate commerce as long as the cumulative effect of that class of activities nationally would have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.  (Wickard, Perez, Heart of Atlanta; McClung).

3. The irrelevance of congressional motivation:  Congress may directly regulate interstate commerce for any reason, even if Congress’s "real" purpose is to achieve some goal that would otherwise be outside its constitutional authority.  E.g., in Darby, Congress prohibited the interstate transport of goods produced by workers receiving below the federal minimum wage; this is a constitutional exercise of the commerce power, even if Congress’s "real" purpose was to regulate wage rates not interstate commerce.  Similarly, in Heart of Atlanta and McClung, the Court ruled that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a constitutional exercise of the commerce power, even though Congress’s primary goal was not the regulation of interstate commerce, but the advancement of racial equality and human rights and equal citizenship.

4. Rational basis standard: the courts defer heavily to congressional assertions that a particular activity "substantially affects" interstate commerce or that a particular congressional regulation furthers a federal end (like the regulation of interstate commerce.)   If there is any reasonable basis for such congressional assertions (formal findings are not required) the courts will accept them.  (E.g. Perez). The question on rational basis review is not whether the regulated activity actually has a substantial effect on interstate commerce, but rather whether Congress could have rationally concluded that the regulated activity has such an effect.

*What does Lopez (as interpreted by Morrison) do to this analysis?*

*What are the three categories of permissible commerce clause legislation under Lopez?*  

*How will the Court apply the "substantial effects" test after Lopez and Morrison?*
	• What's the analysis if the regulated activity is "economic"?   
	• What's the analysis if the regulated activity is deemed to be "non-economic"?  
	• Under what circumstances may Congress regulate "non-economic" activity under the commerce clause and what is the standard of review?  See, e.g., Raich (the medical marijuana case.)  

[A summary of the Commerce Power after Lopez and Morrison is attached to this outline as an addendum – please review it.]

### Commerce Power After Lopez and Morrison

*U.S. v. Lopez* (1995) - Categories of Permissible Commerce Clause Legislation

Congress may:

1.   Regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce.
2.   Regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come from intrastate activities.
3.   Regulate activities that have a substantial relation to interstate commerce or that substantially affect interstate commerce.

For category 3 (the substantial effects test):

**If the regulated activity is “ECONOMIC”:** the Wickard aggregation rule applies; the court asks whether Congress could rationally conclude that the regulated activity, considered in the aggregate nationally, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.  (The answer is invariably yes.)

**If the regulated activity is “NON-ECONOMIC”:** our working rule is that the court will NOT consider the aggregate impact of “non-economic” activity in determining whether Congress may regulate that activity under the substantial effects test.

Under what circumstances may Congress regulate “non-economic” activity under the commerce clause?

1.  If the legislation fits into Lopez category 1 or 2 (above).
2.  If the regulation of “non-economic activity” is an essential part of a broader regulation of “economic” activity (e.g., *Gonzalez v. Raich*).
3.  Through a statute with a jurisdictional element limiting the statute’s application case-by-case to activity having a nexus with interstate commerce. (See the amended Gun Free School Zones Act.)

Raich:  In determining whether a regulation of non-economic activity is “an essential part of a broader regulation of economic activity” the court asks whether Congress could rationally conclude that “failure to regulate that class of [non-economic] activity would undercut” Congress’s broader regulation of economic activity.  (In other words, Congress may consider the cumulative impact of a non-economic activity for purposes of determining whether regulation of that activity is essential to a broader economic regulatory scheme.)  In Raich, Congress could consider not only whether failure to regulate the plaintiff’s medical marijuana plants would undercut regulation of the marijuana market – it could consider whether failure to regulate that activity in the aggregate (i.e., all home-grown medical marijuana) would undermine its broader economic regulation.

*What does the NFIB v. Sebelius (the Affordable Care Act case) do to the doctrine?* (assuming CJ Roberts' opinion regarding the commerce power – though formally dictum – reflects the approach that a majority of the Court endorses.) Note:  the impact (if any) of Sebelius on commerce power doctrine will NOT be tested on the Midterm.

"The Court’s affirmative commerce clause jurisprudence for the most part subjects national legislation to a form of rational basis review." (scroll DCC 1)

## Tenth Amendment

The Tenth Amendment currently does not operate as a limit on Congress' power under Article I to (a) regulate private activities or (b) regulate state activities through federal statutes of general applicability (federal statutes that apply equally to state entities and private entities, such as the minimum wage law in Garcia).  In addition, the Tenth Amendment does not limit Congress’s civil rights powers (e.g. section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment). Why not?

With regard to federal statutes that are directed solely at states "in their capacity as sovereigns" (or at state or local officials) the Court will inquire into whether the regulation invades a core sphere of state sovereignty.   This is the rule first set forth in New York v. United States.  The Court there held that federal legislation attempting to "commandeer state legislative processes" by requiring a state legislature to enact federal regulatory standards impermissibly violates state sovereignty.  And in Printz, the Court flatly held that Congress may not order State or local executive or law enforcement officials "to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program."   

By contrast, the Court in these cases recognized that Congress may make federal funds contingent upon state adoption and enforcement of federal standards (so long as the federal inducement does not rise to the level of "coercion") and that Congress may still preempt state action (nullify state acts that touch upon area over which Congress has constitutional authority). Printz also confirms that the Tenth Amendment does not prevent Congress from requiring state judges to enforce federal law.  

Issues to consider:  what counts as legislation directed solely at states or at "states in their sovereign capacity"?  (Why did the Court uphold the Drivers' Privacy Protection Act in Reno v. Condon?)  What counts as "coercion" under the N.Y. v. U.S. analysis? Under Sebelius (the Obamacare case)? Suppose a state legislature had to enact statutory amendments in order to comply with the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.  Does that pose a tenth amendment problem?  Why (not)?

The meaning of Murphy v. NCAA: In essence the Court held that Congress may not (at least though exercise of an Article I power) “issue direct orders to state legislatures” – even if the congressional “order” purports to bar a state legislature from acting as opposed to requiring a state legislature to act (as in New York v U.S.)  [Although the 10th amendment bars Congress from ordering a state legislature not to enact certain laws, Congress may preempt (render null) any laws the state adopts so long as Congress is acting within its delegated powers.]

For example, in Murphy itself, nothing would prevent Congress from outlawing sports betting directly, in which case any law that New Jersey enacted authorizing such betting would be preempted and void under the Supremacy Clause.  What bothered the Murphy Court was that Congress issued an order to state legislatures prohibiting them from adopting such laws.

## Dormant Commerce clause

"Congress has the plenary power to regulate the channels, instrumentalities and any activity that substantially affects interstate commerce. However, this authority is not absolute. States are allowed to regulate commerce if such regulation is not preempted by federal law, and so long as the State regulation does not discriminate against out of staters. If the state regulation discriminates on its face against out of staters, it violates the DCC unless the regulation is necessary for a compelling state interest (strict scrutiny). If the regulation does not discriminate against out of staters, it usually will be upheld so long as it does not unduly burden interstate commerce." (Answer A to Question 5 of the July 2018 California Bar Exam)[^7]

[^7]:This is from [juraxbar.com](https://juraxbar.com/approach-to-dormant-commerce-clause-easy-set-up/#comment-5749), a CA website that breaks it down decently.

*To check if the law discriminates on its face, see if State A law explicitly favors its residents over the residents of other states. If so, the law discriminates on its face and I should discuss strict scrutiny.*

Three Common Sub-Rules under the Dormant Commerce Clause.

1. Unduly burdensome. Key: State’s Non-economic interest. Not difficult to analyze.
2. The Market-Participant Doctrine. Not difficult to analyze.
3. Discriminates on its face (the language of the statute explicitly discriminates). Use this element to help you: “No less discriminatory alternatives.” Usually the state will not prevail here.

Here is how you analyze these Sub-Rules.

1. Unduly burdensome. Key: Discuss State’s Non-Economic Interest. Apply a balancing test. Discuss the state police powers: Health, safety, and welfare.

2. The Market-Participant Doctrine. Use this rule: “When a state or local government enters the market as a participant it is not subject to the restraints of the Commerce Clause.” Then determine whether the state is a market participant. There are exceptions to the market-participant rule.

3. Discriminates on its face (the language explicitly discriminates). Key: No less discriminatory alternatives. Strict scrutiny is implicated (as mentioned above). Use this rule: “The state must show that it advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives. This is a high standard that the state must meet.”

## My Rule and Steps of Analysis for The Dormant Commerce Clause

The first issue is whether the [statute or regulation] violates the commerce clause.

Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress power to regulate interstate and international commerce.

Here, [the statute or regulation] was not enacted by Congress, but by a state.

Therefore, the commerce clause does not apply.

While the commerce clause gives Congress power to regulate interstate commerce, it does not clearly define what power is left to the states to regulate foreign or interstate commerce if Congress has passed no act or if its legislation does not clearly rule on the ground covered by the enacted state legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the commerce clause as implying a limitation on state power to regulate matters affecting interstate commerce. The commerce clause is thus both a “positive” grant of power to Congress, and a “negative” constraint upon the states which permits the courts to measure state legislation against Commerce Clause values even in the absence of congressional regulation, that is, when Congress’s exercise of its power is dormant. This doctrine is known as the Dormant Commerce Clause. Thus, under the Dormant Commerce Clause, Congress has power to decide whether state legislative power was validly exercised.

The Dormant Commerce Clause Doctrine prohibits state legislation that discriminates against, or unduly burdens, interstate or international commerce, or has a protectionist purpose. In determining whether state legislation discriminates against interstate or international commerce, Courts look at whether a state regulation (1) discriminates on its face against interstate commerce or (2) has the purpose or effect of discriminating against interstate commerce. While a state may not discriminate in favor of private citizens or actors, it may discriminate in its own favor. *United Haulers Assn. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority*, 550 U.S. 330 (2007) (Flow-control ordinance favoring government but treating in-state and out-of-state private businesses the same did not excessively burden interstate commerce). There are two exceptions to the DCC: (1) when congress consents to or preempts state legislation; and (2) when a state or local government enters the market as a participant it is not subject to the restraints of the Commerce Clause.

The first issue is whether [the statute or regulation] is overtly discriminatory or facially neutral.

A statute overtly discriminates against interstate commerce if it advances an in-state or local enterprise and burdens out-of-state business. A statute is facially neutral if it does not advance in-state or local enterprise nor burden out-of-state business.  

Here, ...

Therefore, [the statute or regulation] is [overtly discriminatory or facially neutral].

To determine whether an overtly discriminatory statute is permissible under the dormant commerce clause, the court subjects the statute to a type of heightened scrutiny sometimes not unlike equal protection strict scrutiny. The state must make a "compelling showing" (1) of a "neutral, non-protectionist state interest or purpose"; and (2) that no less discriminatory means are available to achieve the state interest.[^8]

[^8]: Alternative overtly discrimatory test from juraxbar: “The state must show that it advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives. This is a high standard that the state must meet.”

A facially discriminatory statute may have a non-protectionist state interest. Does this mean it passes the test?

To determine whether a facially neutral statute is permissible under the dormant commerce clause doctrine, the court applies a standard of review similar to rational basis review, to determine whether the statute discriminates against interstate commerce. "Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative public benefit. . . And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will depend on the nature of the local interest and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities." *Pike v. Bruch Church* (1970).

**PIKE BALANCING TEST FOR FACIALLY NEUTRAL**

The Pike balancing test requires us to ask (1) whether the state interest is legitimate; (2) whether the statute does not unduly burden interstate commerce; and (3) whether there are less discriminatory means to achieve that end (the availability of less discriminatory means is considered but not required).

Here, (1) the state interest [is / is not] legitimate because .... . (2) The means employed by the state [are / are not] reasonably related to the statutory goal because ... . (3) The state [could have / could not have] achieved its ends by using less discriminatory means because ... *to see if unduly burdensome, discuss state's non-economic interest including state police powers: health, safety and welfare.*

Therefore, the dormant commerce clause [does / does not] prohibit the state's enactment of [the statute] because the state's interest in the statute [is / is not] legitimate, the means the state employs to achieve its end [is / is not] reasonably related to that end, and the state [could have / could not have] achieved its end by using less discriminatory means.  '

The next question is whether any caveats, special cases or exceptions apply.

A facially neutral state-enacted statute with incidental discriminatory effects on interstate commerce is not prohibited by the dormant commerce clause if (a) congress consents to or preempts the statute; (b) the state is a market participant; or (c) the discrimination is in favor of the government.  

Here, ...

Therefore, ...    



The second question is whether [the statute or regulation] has a protectionist purpose.

If the purpose of a statute is protectionist, the statute is impermissible. A statute is protectionist if it intends to benefit "local private economic actors at the expense of out-of-state economic actors". "The Court appears to set forth a categorical prohibition against attempts on the part of any single state to isolate itself from difficulties common to all [states] by restraining the transportation of persons and property across its borders." *Edwards v. California*, 314 U.S. 160 (1941) ("California statute that made it a crime to help a poor person enter the state is unconstitutional").

Here, ... [hoarding]

Therefore, the [statute or regulation] [has / does not have] a protectionist purpose.




However,

(impermissible): law MOTIVATED by protectionism. court prohibits. protectionist statutes are unconstitionial.

if statute burdens out of state goods only, or if hoarding

is it overtly discriminatory or facially neutral?

if facially neutral with incidental impact, (add rules from slides)




1. protectionist purpose
2. overtly discriminatory
3. facially neutral


facially or overtly discriminates against interstate commerce.


1.
2. Note that




""[W]here simple economic protectionism is effected by state legislation, a virtual per se rule of invalidity has been erected.  .  .  But where other legislative objectives are credibly advanced and there is no patent discrimination against interstate trade, the Court has adopted a much more flexible approach the general contours of which were outlined in Pike v. Bruce Church:  Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative public benefit. . . And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will depend on the nature of the local interest and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities." *Philadelphia v. New Jersey* (quoting *Pike v. Bruch Church* (1970))."

## Dormant Commerce Clause from review session with Asima 4-30-22

this is not in any of loffredo's outlines. start with a really good rule for this.

remember rule statements from midterms

if whether violate the commerce clause might be whether violated dormant commerce clause

issue: whether ESSRA sec 3 and 4 violated commerce Clause
who enacted the law being challenged?
not congress (if it were congress commerce clause would have been challenged)
state legislature - NYS
not commerce clause but dormant commerce clause analysis

issue 2: whether violate other thing

DCC Doctrine

largely judge-made.
commerce clause + 10th A + supremacy clause
DCC is phrased as an affirmative something (see slide)

art 1 sec 8 clause 3

3 categories for DCC

1. protectionist purpose
2. overtly discriminatory
3. facially neutral

protectionist purpose (impermissible): law MOTIVATED by protectionism. court prohibits. protectionist statutes are unconstitionial.

if statute burdens out of state goods only, or if hoarding

is it overtly discriminatory or facially neutral?

if facially neutral with incidental impact, (add rules from slides)

exceptions

1. see slides
2. see slides
3. market participation

when state acts as market participant dcc does not apply - are they acting like a private actor - look at loffredo's six examples of market participation and market regulation - towards the end of the market participation segment

here, state is acting like a participant because accepting bids and so on BUT state is acting like a market regulator because imposing legislation

Vaughn note from chat re essay 2: when nys decides to buy local for itself that is market participation, but when it orders private businesses to buy local, that is market regulation

if state is just a market participant than the restrictions of dcc does not apply. if market regulator than the facially neutral and overtly discriminatory tests apply.
