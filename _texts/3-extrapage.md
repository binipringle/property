## Practice Essay 1

Practice essay # 1

(Just focus  on question on (1) below)

Oscar owns a vacant tract of land that is accessible on the east side by a public road and otherwise is surrounded by other properties.

In 2000, Oscar granted Cable Company an underground cable-line easement by a properly executed written instrument. Complying with the terms of the easement, Cable Company dug trenches, laid out cables, and returned the surface of the land to the same condition it was in before installing the cables. This easement was never recorded.

In 2004, Oscar conveyed this tract of land, still vacant, to Patrick in a deed that does not refer to the cable-line easement.  Patrick paid full value for the property and had no actual knowledge of the easement.

Although Patrick purchased the land with the intent to develop it, after closing title he decides to hold off on building while he pursues other investments. While the land remains vacant, Antonia, an avid outdoors person and camping enthusiast, discovers the property in June, 2005, and begins using it then for camping and other recreational purposes. As she walks through the property, she comes across a pond on the land. She decides to occupy that part of the property, marking it with a wooden stake (a block of wood) with her name on it so that she’ll recognize her spot. Bringing in her camping gear and a tent, Antonia stays on the land regularly, approximately two weekends each month except in the coldest part of the year (January). She uses the pond for swimming during the summer months and for fishing during other parts of the year. During her occupancy, she has seen other people periodically fishing or swimming in the pond. Antonia has not sought or received permission to enter or use the land.

In the meantime, Patrick has a renewed interest in the property and in 2012 hires an engineer to inspect the site. To assess the suitability of the property for construction, the engineer begins excavating on the site and learns for the first time that the Cable Company had installed cables below the surface of the soil that were not otherwise visible upon inspecting the property. While at the site, the engineer also sees Antonia fishing and camping near the pond. He informs Patrick of these two discoveries.

It is now April, 2012. Patrick comes to you for legal advice. He has questions about the legal effect of the cable-line easement, and he wants to know if he can succeed in a legal action to confirm his ownership rights in the property against a potential claim of adverse possession by Antonia.


The relevant statutes in this jurisdiction provide as follows:

“A prior grant or conveyance of an interest in real property, including a non-possessory interest such as an easement, that is not recorded is not valid against any subsequent purchaser, who, without notice, purchases the real property in good faith and for valuable consideration.”

“The statutory period to resolve a claim of adverse possession in this jurisdiction is seven years. This jurisdiction applies an objective standard, and does not require a showing of the possessor’s subjective state of mind.”

Questions:

1. Did Patrick take the property subject to the cable-line easement?

NOTE: (i) Analyze the facts to determine whether Patrick qualifies for the protection afforded purchasers under the terms of statute (A); (ii) Include in your answer what category of recording act statute (A) is (one sentence).

NOTE: for questions 1 and 2 structure your answers as follows:

1. State the issue
2. State relevant rule or rules that apply to the issue
3. Apply the rules completely to the facts
4. State a conclusion

## Sample answer to Practice Essay 1

*analyze the facts to determine whether Patrick qualifies for the protection afforded purchasers under the terms of statute A.; include in your answer what category of recording act statute A. is (one sentence)*

**Identify the type of statute:** The recording statute in the state is a notice-type statute, providing that unrecorded conveyances are not valid against a subsequent purchaser for value and without notice of the conveyance. (The subsequent bona fide purchaser for value has priority. BFP does not have to record in order to gain priority but purchaser is still motivated to record quickly. If s/he fails to do so, s/he may lose the interest to a bona fide purchaser subsequent to her. About half of the states use notice statutes.)

**Easement Question**

**Issue:** Whether Patrick took the property subject to the cable-line easement when he purchase property from Oscar.

**Rule:** In a notice jurisdiction, a grant or conveyance of an interest in real property is not valid against a subsequent purchaser of real property for valuable consideration and without notice of prior interest. There are three (3) types of notices: (i) actual, (ii) inquiry and (iii) record.  (i) Actual notice is actual knowledge of a prior interest. (ii) Inquiry notice is notice of any prior interest that would have been obtained by investigating suspicious circumstances. (iii) Record notice is notice of any prior interest that would have been obtained by investigating suspicious circumstances.

**Application:**

Here, there is a subsequent purchaser because Patrick bought the property after easement is granted.

Here, Patrick paid valuable consideration for the property because the facts state that Patrick paid full value for the property.      

Here, there is no actual notice because the facts clearly state that Patrick had no actual knowledge of the easement and the deed made no reference to the easement.   

Here, there was no inquiry notice because even if Patrick would have inspected the property, he would not have been able to discover the easement. The Cable Company placed the cables in such a manner that it would not be readily discoverable when it dug trenches, laid out cables, and returned the surface of the land to the same condition it was in before installing the cables.    

Here, Patrick did not have record notice because the easement was never recorded,  and thus undiscoverable by a reasonable  search of the public land records (grantor-grantee indexes or any other record search).        

**Conclusion:** Therefore, Patrick did not take the property subject to the cable line easement when Patrick buys property as a subsequent purchaser who had no notice of easement and paid valuable consideration for property.

## Practice Essay 2

Gerson owned a large tract of land that had access to the state highway, which ran along the property’s western border. The property was otherwise surrounded by land owned by others on the north, south, and east sides and he had no legal access to a public street other than the state highway to the west. Gerson lived on the western half of the property, so that he would have easy access to the highway. However, on the eastern half of the property he owned and operated a business consisting of several greenhouses for growing a variety of flowering plants. He paved a long driveway that connected the greenhouses on the eastern side to his residence in the western side of the property. The driveway also gave access to the state highway. Gerson regularly used this paved driveway, which could be seen from the highway, to travel between his home, the greenhouses, and the highway.

Eventually, Gerson decided to sell the greenhouses and the land on which the greenhouses stood on the eastern portion of his property to the Greenes, a young couple just starting out in the greenhouse business. Gerson continued to own and occupy the western half of the property. In an effort to save money, the Greenes moved into a small cottage that was located near the greenhouses on the land they owned. The deed that Gerson transferred to the Greenes made no mention of the paved driveway. However, with Gerson’s consent, the Greenes used this driveway that Gerson had created and previously used, to travel from their cottage and greenhouses on the east to the western side of the property, which was their only access to the state highway.

Six years later, Gerson died and his nephew Noel inherited the uncle’s property.

Noel moved into his late uncle’s home and noticed the Greenes’ use of the driveway that crossed the property he inherited. He stopped them one day and announced that he intended to charge them $125 a month ($1500 per year) for the continued use of the driveway.

Do the Greenes have a valid right of way to use the driveway?

Questions: Analyze each of the following two types of easements and, for each easement type, determine whether the Greenes could likely meet its requirements:

1. Easement implied by prior use;
2. Easement by necessity.

NOTE: In analyzing each type of easement, please state the issue, set out in full the requirements for establishing the easement (that is, the rule), and apply the rule completely to the facts stated above. Please state your conclusion and indicate your supporting reasons as well as your degree of certainty whether the requirements of each of the two easements listed above are or are not likely met under these facts.

## Sample answer to Practice Essay 2

**1. Easement Implied by Prior Use**

**Issue:** Whether the Greenes have an easement implied by prior use when Gerson consented to Greenes use of driveway across his property upon conveyance and then Gerson’s property was inherited by Nephew Noel?

**Rule:** An implied easement exists when (i) there was a single ownership of dominant and servient parcels; (ii) a conveyance or other transfer separated that ownership; (iii) before the conveyance dividing owner’s unified title, owner of parcel used one part of the unified parcel for the benefit of another part of it; (iv) before the conveyance, owner’s use was apparent and obvious, continuous, and permanent; (v) circumstances at the time of the severance of title indicate that original owner intended to give grantee an easement across what remained of owner’s land; and (vi) claimed easement is necessary and beneficial to the enjoyment of the parcel conveyed or retained by the grantor.

**Application:**

Here, there was a single ownership of dominant and servient parcels because Gerson owned of the entire property prior to conveyance.

Here, there is a conveyance separated that ownership because Gerson conveyed part of his entire property to the Greenes.

Here, before the conveyance dividing owner Gerson’s unified title, Gerson used one part of the unified parcel for the benefit of another part because before conveying the eastern side of the property to the Greenes, Gerson paved a long driveway that connected the greenhouses on the eastern side to his residence in the western side of the property and also gave access to the state highway.

Here, before the conveyance, Gerson’s use of one part of the property for the benefit of the other parcel was apparent and obvious, continuous, and permanent because before the conveyance, Gerson openly used this paved driveway, which could be seen from the highway and regularly did so to travel between the greenhouses on one side of the property  and  his home and the highway on the other side.

Here, the circumstances at the time of the severance of title DO indicate that original owner Gerson intended to give grantee the Greenes an easement across what remained of owner’s land because when Gerson sold the eastern portion of the property to the Greenes, though the deed from  Gerson made no mention of the paved driveway, Gerson’s consented to allowing the Greene’s to use this driveway that Gerson had created and previously used, to travel from their cottage and greenhouses on the east to the western side of the property, which was their only access to the state highway.

Here, the access to the was necessary and beneficial to the Greenes’ enjoyment of the parcel Gerson conveyed because otherwise they would not have access to the highway.

**Conclusion:** Therefore, the Greenes have an easement implied by prior use when Gerson sold the Greenhouses and the land they stood , i.e. the East, on to the Greene’s.

**2. Easement By Necessity**

**Issue:** Whether the Greenes have an easement by necessity when Gerson consented to Greenes use of driveway across his property upon conveyance and then Gerson’s property was inherited by Nephew Noel.

**Rule:** For easement by necessity, there must be (i) division of property originally held by single owner; (ii) division resulted in creating a landlocked parcel; (iii) owner of servient estate is entitled to select route of easement by necessity, so long as it is reasonable; (iv) easement remains in effect as long as necessity exists; (v) easement will not arise if this would contradict affirmative showing of actual intent of the parties not to provide access rights.

**Application:**

Here, there was division of property originally held by single owner because the east side and the west side were owned by Gerson and Gerson divided his property in half by conveying half of the entire property to the Greenes.

Here, the division resulted in creating a landlocked parcel because the Greene’s property was otherwise surrounded by land owned by others on the north, south, and east sides and he had no legal access to a public street other than the state highway to the west.

Here, the Greene’s reasonable necessity to use the drive across Gerson’s land because the driveway was their only access to the state highway and the property was landlocked in addition to the fact that it was a pre-established route by Gerson. The issue about changing location of easement is not triggered here because Ned is not seeking change of drive location but seeking compensation for use of the driveway

Here, the necessity still exists because the Greene’s property is still landlock, i.e. surrounded by properties owned by others, including Gerson and they have no legal right to use property other than Gerson’s to access the highway.

Here, there is no affirmative showing from Gerson of actual intent to not to provide access rights because at the time of the conveyance, Gerson consented to the Greene’s use of the driveway that Gerson had created.  While Ned would argue that the deed conveying interest from Gerson to Greenes did not mention the easement and thus shows lack of intent, Gerson’s affirmative consent trumps the lack of mention in the deed.

**Conclusion:** Therefore, the Greenes have an easement by necessity when Gerson consented to Greenes use of driveway across his property upon conveyance and then Gerson’s property was inherited by Nephew Noel.
