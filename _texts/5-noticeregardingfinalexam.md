Final exam will be released on Wednesday, May 4 at 6 p.m. via TWEN. Exam will close Thursday, May 5 at 8 p.m. If tech issues contact Paul Cabrera paul.cabrera@law.cuny.edu. Use only Exam ID number on answers.  

Exam is modified “open book” as follows: you may use your textbook, notes, any other material from the Con Structs TWEN page, or any other hard-copy material or documents saved to your device before the exam. You may not run web searches or otherwise use the internet to gather material during the exam, and may not communicate with anyone about the exam. You must use quotation marks to show any text used verbatim in your essays, other than text that is your own work (or work on which you collaborated).

The examination will consist of two essay questions, each of which will require discussion of one or more doctrines. A total of 4 doctrines will appear on the exam.

The essay questions will be of the standard doctrinal sort and will draw from the following areas:

1. standing (not ripeness or mootness);
2. eleventh amendment/state sovereign immunity;
3. Congress’s spending power;
4. Congress’s commerce power;
5. the tenth amendment; and
6. the negative or “dormant” commerce clause (including the market participant exception).

Not all of these doctrines will necessarily appear on the exam. Doctrines not on the list will not be on the exam.

Essay answers should:

1. identify the issue(s) presented by the fact pattern.
2. accurately and completely set forth the governing rule(s) of law; and
3. perform a thorough, well-reasoned fact-law analysis.  Your analyses should touch upon every element of the governing legal rule, even if you believe that one particular element is dispositive.

Prediction: in terms of the topics, we had four broad topics: judicial power, state and local power (dormant commerce clause and exceptions)

prioritize

1. dormant commerce Clause
2. commerce Clause
3. 11th a
4. conditional spending
5. 10th a
6. standing last  

possible issues:

judicial power: does the court have the power to hear (this was from Asima's notes)
