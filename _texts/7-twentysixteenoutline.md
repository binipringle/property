## Standing

At issue is whether or not the plaintiff has standing to bring the claim, and thus whether or not the Court has the authority to hear this particular case.

Justiciability asks whether the federal court has power to hear a particular case. Specifically, justiciability doctrine encompasses the doctrines of standing, ripeness, mootness and political questions. Standing doctrine asks whether the plaintiff has a sufficient stake in the lawsuit to give rise to an Article III “case or controversy” and to satisfy the Supreme Court’s judge-made, non-constitutional “prudential limitations.” Article III standing must be proved for every case or controversy, each form of relief requested, and throughout each stage in the proceeding. Lyons.

A plaintiff, or the party invoking federal jurisdiction, bears the burden of satisfying Article III case or controversy requirements by establishing these three elements: (1) Actual or threatened injury in fact, (2) causation that is fairly traceable to the defendant’s actions, (3) redressability in terms of relief the court can afford.

An actual or threatened injury in fact is an invasion of a legally protected interest. A legally protected interest includes the invasion of individual constitutional rights, a violation of a statutory right, an economic deprivation, an emotional harm, a harm that affects a person’s life, and an aesthetic or environment interest. The legally protected interest must be concrete and particularized, Whitmore v. Arkansas, as opposed to abstract. An injury is concrete when it actually exists and is not abstract. Spokeo. A concrete injury may be tangible (i.e., economic, health, freedom), or it may be intangible (i.e., free exercise of religion), and tangible injuries are generally easier to recognize than intangible injuries. Spokeo. In order to determine if an injury is concrete enough to establish an injury in fact, the Court will look to history and congressional intent. Spokeo. The Court has found that procedural interests tied to a substantive right are concrete enough to satisfy injury in fact.  However, if a procedural right is not tied to substantive right, it will not satisfy injury in fact. An injury is particularized when it affects the plaintiff in a personal and individual way. Spokeo. Congress can create laws that give rise to an injury and can protect widely share interests, so long as the interests are concrete and not abstract, meaning individual plaintiffs suffer injuries in a concrete and particularized way. Akins. Injuries can be past, present, or threatened future injuries. If the injury is a threatened future injury, then it must be imminent, which falls somewhere along the spectrum of posing a significant risk to a plaintiff’s legally protected interest, Dreihaus, to a certainly impending actual injury (in a national security context) that is more than mere speculation, Clapper.

Causation is fairly traceable to the defendant’s challenged conduct when (1) there is a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of and (2) the injury is not the result of the independent action of a third party not before the Court. Allen v. Wright. The Court sets a high standard for causal links, but third parties may be intermediate links in the chain of causation. Often, separation of powers concerns influence the ways courts flesh out causation, and the Court uses causation to manipulate standing.

Redressability means that the Court must be able to redress or mitigate the plaintiff’s injury in some way. It must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. The decision must remedy at least part of the alleged injury, but it is not necessary for the Court to remedy the entire injury or even give the plaintiff the relief they are ultimately seeking. Akins. A person who is accorded a procedural right to protect concrete interests can assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy. Lujan, n.7.

After a plaintiff establishes an Article III case or controversy, their standing may still be limited by non-constitutional, judge-made prudential limitations. Doctrine around these limitations is evolving, but the Court currently recognizes two prudential limitations: (1) no generalized grievances and (2) no assertion of third party rights.

A plaintiff will not have standing if they are asserting a generalized grievance that is shared in substantially equal measure by all or a large class of citizens. Warth v. Seldin. There is no “tax payer standing” in federal court. Although citizen suit provisions are generally barred, Congress can create laws that give rise to an injury and can protect widely share interests, so long as the interests are concrete and not abstract, meaning individual plaintiffs suffer injuries in a concrete and particularized way. Akins. Under this rule, a citizen-suit provision will only be lawful if Congress clearly articulates the protected statutory interests, identify the class of persons protected and authorized to bring suit, and identify chains of causation.

The plaintiff’s injury cannot be the result of the independent action of a third party not before the Court. Allen v. Wright. The Court has, however, recognized four exceptions: (1) Congress may override this limitation by statute; (2) enforcement of the challenged policy against litigant would result indirectly in the violation of third parties’ rights, see Craig v. Boren (barkeeper sued, not the young boys); (3) enforcement of the challenged policy would adversely affect a relationship existing between the litigant and the third parties whose rights are assertedly violated, see Griswold v. Connecticut (enforcement of law criminally punishing medical providers for providing birth control resulted in violation of rights of third party patients seeking birth control); (4) if the third party who is the real party in interest is otherwise disabled from bringing suit because of a genuine obstacle or practical impossibility, e.g., minors who can’t sue in federal court on their own behalf.

An actual past injury does not necessarily give plaintiff standing to seek an injunction for prospective relief, rather the past injury has to be reasonably likely to recur. Lyons.  The Court evaluates whether the injury is reasonably likely to recur by weighing these six factors: (1) the injury or challenged conduct is as a result of a clearly authorized official policy, (2) the plaintiff has been subjected to the conduct more than one time, (3) there are many instances of the challenged conduct, (4) the plaintiff is at risk of repeat injury even if the plaintiff is not involved in the unlawful activity, (5) the defendant is not a state or local law enforcement entity, and (6) it is a class action lawsuit, where many plaintiffs are challenging the same conduct.

APPLICATION/EXPLANATION

Here, it is likely/unlikely that the Court will find that the plaintiff has standing.

First, the Court will determine whether or not there is an Article III case or controversy by determining if there is (1) an actual or threatened injury in fact

Here, there was/was not an actual or threatened injury in fact.

Case examples:

●	In Allen v. Wright, the Court found that a nationwide class of Black schoolchildren did not have standing to bring a claim against the IRS for providing tax exemptions to segregated, white private religious schools, in part, because the alleged injury that Black schoolchildren were harmed because the government gave financial aid to discriminatory private schools was too abstract.

●	In Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, the plaintiffs did not have standing when they challenged a statute that restricted the applicability of an endangered species act to only domestic actions and not international actions, alleging that this would allow for extinction of endangered species abroad. There, the plaintiffs alleged that their threatened injury was that they would not be able to scientifically observe or study, or aesthetically appreciate these animals once there were extinct. The Court, however, found there was no injury because the plaintiffs, who had previously travelled abroad to observe these animals, had no plans or plane tickets to go abroad.

●	In FEC v. Akins, the Court held that plaintiffs could allege widely shared harms so long as those harms are concrete and not abstract, as they were here where a group of voters sued the FEC seeking disclosure under FOIA of certain information regarding AIPAC campaign contributions.

●	In Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l, the court found that the threatened injury of the phones of human rights lawyers communicating with their clients was not imminent enough because it was not certainly impending, meaning it was too speculative. Thus, there was not injury in fact.

●	In Susan B. Anthony v. Driehaus, the court found that a pre-enforcement challenge, or a threatened injury, was sufficiently imminent because the plaintiff alleges an intention to engage in a course of conduct that will pose a significant risk to a plaintiff’s legally protected interest.

●	In Lyons, the plaintiff’s past injury of being placed in a chokehold, which gave rise to a damages claim, did not in and of itself give rise to a claim for a prospective injunction against that conduct in the future. Thus, Lyons did not have standing to seek the injunction unless he could show that the future harm was substantially likely by applying these six factors: (1) challenged conduct is authorized by official policy (here the chokehold policy), (2) plaintiff was subjected to the conduct more than once (here, Lyons was only stopped for a broken taillight and placed in a chokehold once), (3) many instances of challenged conduct (here, only happened to Lyons once, even though there were statistics that this happened all over LA), (4) Defendant is not a state or local law enforcement entity (here, LAPD was), and (5) class action (had Lyons brought this as a class action, there may have been standing).
(2)	causation that is fairly traceable to the defendant’s actions.

Here, there was/was not causation that is fairly traceable to the defendant’s actions.

Case examples:

●	In Allen v. Wright, the Court found that a nationwide class of Black schoolchildren did not have standing to bring a claim against the IRS for providing tax exemptions to segregated, white private religious schools, in part, because the alleged injury that Black schoolchildren were harmed because the government gave financial aid to discriminatory private schools was too abstract, and thus could not be fairly traced to the defendant, IRS’s actions.

●	In Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l, the plaintiffs did not have standing because the court found that the threatened injury of the phones of human rights lawyers communicating with their clients was not imminent enough because it was not certainly impending, meaning it was too speculative. Thus, there was not an injury in fact that could be fairly traceable to a defendant’s actions.

(3)	redressability in terms of relief the court can afford.

Here, there was/was not redressability.

Case examples:

●	In FEC v. Akins, the plaintiffs did have standing and the Court finds that their injury is redressable because the group of voters sued the FEC for information regarding AIPAC campaign contribution under FOIA, and the Court could direct that their FOIA request be granted, even though the information they get may or may not cover all of the relief they sought.

Second, the Court will determine if their standing may still be limited by non-constitutional, judge-made prudential limitations:

(1)	no generalized grievances

Here, there are/are not generalized grievances.

Case examples:

●	In FEC v. Akins, the plaintiffs had standing and the Court found that their request as a group of voters suing the FEC for information regarding AIPAC campaign contribution disclosures was not a generalized grievance because Congress created FOIA and Congress can authorize standing for individuals suffering statutory defined injuries even if those injuries are shared by many citizens, so long as the injury is concrete and particularized and the statute identifies the right, relates it to a group of people and authorizes the suit.

●	Warth v. Seldin places it here, whereas Lexmark dicta places generalized grievance under Article III limitation.

(2)	no assertion of third party rights.

Here, there are/are not assertions of third party rights.

Case examples:

●	In Allen v. Wright, the Court found that a nationwide class of Black schoolchildren did not have standing to bring a claim against the IRS for providing tax exemptions to segregated, white private religious schools, in part, because it seemed that the plaintiffs were asking the court regulate the rights of a third party (the religious schools) in a particular way.

●	In Pierce v. Soc’y of Sisters, parents had standing because the parents, who were third parties, had the substantive due process right to educate their children, even though the case was about Nebraska law that prevented any schools from teaching children any non-English language and thus impacted private schools.

●	In Griswold, there was standing because enforcement of law criminally punishing medical providers for providing birth control resulted violated the rights of third party patients seeking birth control.

CONCLUSION

Thus, the Court will find that the plaintiff does/does not have standing.


## 11th Amendment State Sovereign Immunity

ISSUE
	At issue is whether or not the federal court has the authority, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment and related state sovereign immunity principles, to award plaintiff the requested relief.

RULE
	The text of the Eleventh Amendment places narrow limits on the ability to sue states. The modern court, however, has greatly expanded the substantive meaning of the Eleventh Amendment to include allied principles of state sovereign immunity that broadly protect states from being sued, using rhetoric around principles of federalism and states’ rights as justification for imposing these limitations. State sovereign immunity limits the power of the federal judiciary to hear claims brought by plaintiffs other than the U.S. or another state against state defendants unless the state has unequivocally waived its immunity or Congress has unequivocally abrogated the states immunity through the valid exercise of a constitutional power that authorizes that abrogation. Seminole Tribe. This immunity applies in federal court, state court, and federal administrative proceedings. This immunity applies to both federal, see Edelman, and state law claims, see Pennhurst.
A state defendant includes the state, state agencies, state officials acting in an official capacity, and any other agency or political subdivision that is acting as an “arm of the state” in that they are (1) under state control and (2) state financially liable for litigation.
 The only plaintiffs who can sue a state are the U.S. federal government, US agencies or other states. Foreign governments, citizens of the state, and citizens of another state cannot sue a state defendant.
There are three exceptions to a state’s immunity from suit under the Eleventh Amendment: (1) state has unequivocally waived state sovereign immunity via statute, (2) congressional abrogation, and (3) an Ex Parte Young suit.
A state can unequivocally waive its sovereign immunity by statute, but the Court has imposed a high threshold for waiver, which it construes narrowly requiring a clear statement of waiver and any ambiguity in the language of the statement will not constitute a waiver. See Edelman. There will be no implied waiver just because a state is voluntarily participating in a federal program or obeying federal standards. There will also be no constructive waiver except in the narrow circumstance where a state has waived immunity in state court and voluntarily removes the case to federal court with the goal of avoiding suit by claiming immunity. See Lapides. The federal government can induce states to waive their sovereign immunity by conditioning receipt of federal funds on waiver, but the government may not coerce states to broadly waive their sovereign immunity.
Congress can abrogate state sovereign immunity if (1) the statute is an exercise of a valid constitutional power that authorizes abrogation of state sovereign immunity, either through its civil rights enforcement powers under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment or through the Bankruptcy Clause,   and (2) Congress makes its intent to abrogate unmistakably clear in the text of the statute, specifying some private right of action in federal court for a particular type of relief.
An Ex Parte Young suit may be brought against (1) a state official acting in his or her official capacity (2) on a federal claim for (3) prospective relief, i.e., for relief necessary to halt an ongoing violation of federal law and any ancillary relief, e.g. attorney’s fees, including for ongoing relief for continuing effects of past harm, Milliken v. Bradley, (4) LIMITATION: except where Congress intended the statute to be exclusive. The Court will determine if Congress intended the statute to be exclusive by evaluating: (1) if there was a detailed, comprehensive, remedial scheme that is more narrow than the relief one could get via Ex Parte Young  and (2) if the Ex parte Young suit would allow for broader relief than that which is statutorily proscribed, reading the statute carefully to protect states.

APPLICATION
	Here, the Court will likely find that the statute/act/law validly/invalidly abrogates/waives/falls under an Ex parte Young exception, and thus authorizes/does not authorize plaintiff’s suit.
	First, the Court will determine if Eleventh Amendment Immunity, including allied principles of state sovereign immunity applies, and thus limits the power of the federal judiciary to hear claims brought by plaintiffs other than the U.S. or another state against state defendants Seminole Tribe.
1.	State defendant
Case Examples
●	In Seminole Tribe, the plaintiffs were a tribe suing the state of Florida, a state defendant.
●	State, state agency, “arm of state”
2.	Plaintiff (U.S. or other state)
3.	Federal claim or state claim
Case Examples
●	In Pennhurst, the plaintiff had a disability and sued Pennhurst State School under state and federal law. The lower court found that the plaintiff had a federal law claim, but the Supreme Court found that the plaintiff did not have a federal claim, and on remand, a federal appellate court found that the state law supported the plaintiff's claim. So, the school appealed on the grounds that the Eleventh Amendment prohibited a federal court from ordering state officials to comply with the provisions of state law, and the Court agreed. Although the Eleventh Amendment allows the Court to assume jurisdiction when there is a controversy between the citizen of a state with another state, the Constitution did not contemplate the extension of federal jurisdictional authority over suits against states that do not consent to be parties to litigation, and the same applies to the exercise of federal jurisdiction over suits brought by a citizen against his own state.
●	In Alden v. Maine, Alden, a probation officer, sued the State of Maine over overtime provisions under the Fair Labor Standards Act seeking damages. Alden first brought the case in federal court where it was dismissed on SSI grounds, so he then brought it in state court. The Court held, however, that Congress's Article I powers do not grant it power to subject non-consenting states to private suits for damages even if filed in state courts, even on federal claims, without the state government's consent.
	Second, the Court will determine if one of the three exceptions to state sovereign immunity applies.
1.	Waiver
●	In Edelman, the Court held that the Eleventh Amendment prohibits federal courts from awarding money damages to citizens against a state, although the Court can order injunctions. Here, the federal court ordered the state of Illinois to pay money damages to people who were harmed due to Illinois' non-compliance with certain provisions of the Aid to the Aged, Blind, or Disabled (AABD) Act and also ordered an injunction to cease their non-compliance with the program. The Supreme Court reversed the award of money damages, but allowed the injunction. Here, the Court also held that Illinois did not constructively waive its immunity through participation in AABD, and waiver will only be found where it was expressly stated.
2.	Congressional Abrogation
●	In Seminole Tribe, the Court held that Congress did not have authority to validly abrogate states' sovereign immunity through an exercise of power not derived from § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Although Congress unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate state sovereign immunity with respect to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), the abrogation was unconstitutional.
●	In Katz, the Court held that states had ceded their claims to state sovereign immunity as to bankruptcy proceedings by virtue of the power granted to Congress in the Bankruptcy Clause.
3.	Ex Parte Young
●	In Seminole Tribe, the Court held that Congress did not have authority to validly abrogate states' sovereign immunity through an exercise of power not derived from § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Although Congress unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate state sovereign immunity with respect to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), the abrogation was unconstitutional. Also,

CONCLUSION
Thus, the federal court does/does not have the authority, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment and related state sovereign immunity principles, to award plaintiff the requested relief.

## 10th Amendment Limitations on Commerce Clause Power

ISSUE
	At issue is whether or not Congress adopted a statute directed solely at a state entity that commands the state in its sovereign capacity to adopt and/or administer a federal law/policy that exceeds the scope of the limitation that the 10th Amendment places on Congress’s power to regulate under the Commerce Clause.

RULE
	The 10th Amendment generally bars Congress from adopting statutes directed solely at state entities that command states in their sovereign capacities to adopt and/or administer federal laws/policies or command local authorities to administer federal regulatory programs. The modern court has used the Tenth Amendment to greatly restrict Congress’s ability to legislate in manners that affect states. The Tenth Amendment imposes judicially enforced limits on Congress’s power to create legislation that is aimed at states and impacts the core of state sovereignty.
For statutes of general applicability, which are directed at private actors and states alike, there are no judicially enforced Tenth Amendment limits. See Garcia (FLSA held constitutional as applied to state employers). Under statutes of general applicability, the statute must clearly state that it applies to state actors as well as private actors.  
For statutes that are directed at states in their non-sovereign capacities, there are no judicially enforceable Tenth Amendment limits. See Garcia; Condon. The Court requires that Congress state clearly in the text of the statute of general applicability that the statute applies to state actors (in addition to private entities).
If, however, the statute impacts the core of state sovereignty because it is directed at states in a “sovereign capacity,” meaning in their capacity as law giver, enforcer, or regulator, then the judiciary may enforce Tenth Amendment limits because there is no intrusion allowed on the core of state sovereignty. After N.Y. v. U.S., Congress can’t “commandeer the legislative process” and direct, require, or compel states or local officials to regulate in a certain area and in accordance with a certain regulatory scheme. After Printz, the Tenth Amendment bars Congress from issuing statutes that commandeer local/state executive officials from carrying out a federal legislative regulatory scheme.
The Tenth Amendment does not apply if (1) states agree to participate in a federal regulatory program, and Congress can use its spending powers to induce states to take action in accordance with federal criteria by offering money subject to the constitutional standards outlined in Dole & Sebelius. Tenth Amendment also does not apply if a state agrees to participate in the administration of a federal regulatory scheme either through (2) Conditional preemption (fed govt gives states a choice of regulating, but if the states do not regulate, the federal government will regulate in that area and preempt state regulation--requires clear statement), or (3) preemption (fed govt regulates in an area and bars states from doing so).

APPLICATION
The first step is to classify the statute. Is it (1) a statute of general applicability OR a statute directed at states in their non-sovereign capacities or (2) a statute directed at states in their “sovereign capacity” as law giver, enactor, and enforcer?
1.	If it is a statute of general applicability (meaning directed at private entities, or at private entities and a state, e.g. FLSA) then Garcia applies and there are no judicially enforceable Tenth Amendments limits. Court requires that Congress state clearly in the text of the statute of general applicability that the statute applies to state actors.
2.	If is a statute directed at states in their non-sovereign capacities then Garcia applies and there are no judicially enforceable Tenth Amendment limits.
Case Example
●	In Reno v. Condon, for instance, South Carolina was selling information they got through the DMV to companies/stalkers and Congress enacted a statute barring states from selling information they got from DMVs. South Carolina sued under the Tenth Amendment alleging the DMV statute was directed at states in their sovereign capacity in violation of the Tenth Amendment, but the Court held that the state was acting as a non-sovereign owners/seller of information as a market participant, and thus was could not be judicially protected under the Tenth Amendment.
3.	If it is a statute directed at states (only) in a “sovereign capacity,” then the Court will find that any such intrusion on the core of state sovereignty is not allowed. The judiciary will therefore enforce the Tenth Amendment limits.
Case Example
●	In N.Y. v. U.S., the Court held that it would distinguish statutes of general applicability from statutes directed solely at states. There, the constitution did not authorize Congress to enact or administer a federal regulatory program directed at states in their sovereign capacity, like the Low Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act, although it could incentivize states to do so. Doing so would require states to legislate according to federal standards which constitutes an unconstitutional commandeering of traditional state policy making functions.
●	In Printz v. U.S.¸ the Supreme Court held that Congress could not compel state or local officials or executive officers to participate in the administration and enforcement of federal programs, like the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (Brady Act), which required state and local officials to conduct background checks on prospective firearms purchasers, and thus compelled state officials to participate in federal service.

CONCLUSION
	Congress did/did not exceed its authority under the Tenth Amendment limitations.

## The Civil Rights Enforcement Power

ISSUE
	At issue is whether or not [federal statute] is a constitutional exercise of Congress’s civil rights enforcement power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.

RULE
The Constitution, mainly § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, gives Congress the power to enforce its civil rights provisions through appropriate legislation. This is a broad power akin to the Necessary and Proper clause to select the means that achieve the equal protection and due process goals of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Congress’s § 5 power is “solely remedial,” Boerne, meaning Congress may enact remedial legislation to prevent, deter, and/or remedy violations of the Fourteenth Amendment. Such remedial legislation can prohibit conduct that is not itself unconstitutional as a means of preventing, deterring, or remedying Fourteenth Amendment violations. Congress does not, however, have the power to interpret, define the scope, or alter the substance of Fourteenth Amendment rights. Boerne. In Morrison, the Court held that Congress may not regulate solely private activity through its civil rights powers.
After Boerne, Congress may outlaw “a somewhat broader swath” of conduct than is prescribed by the Fourteenth Amendment. See Kimel and Garrett. The remedy prescribed, however, must be “congruent and proportional” to the injury or threatened injury to Fourteenth Amendment rights.  The congruence and proportionality test is a fact-specific determination that requires (1) determining the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment right at issue that the legislation seeks to protect (in reference to the Court’s own precedent), (2) determining the scope of the statutory remedy (as applied), (3) comparing the two to see if they are, indeed, congruent and proportional (do the means fit the ends), and (4) where § 5 legislation outlaws a significant amount of constitutional activity, the Court has required Congress to make findings demonstrating the existence of a widespread “pattern of unconstitutional behavior” that the legislation is designed to remedy. See Kimel.  
In applying the congruence and proportionality test, the Court will apply a different standard of review depending on the classification of the Fourteenth Amendment right. When the Fourteenth Amendment provides a narrow protection, then Congress’s § 5 enforcement power is narrow, e.g., not a suspect/quasi-suspect classification or fundamental right, then the Court will give less deference to Congress regarding the civil rights legislation. In this circumstance, the standard of judicial review is akin the intermediate scrutiny, meaning the Court gives Congress less deference regarding the means and ends chosen to advance the government interest, congruence and proportionality, and the legislative record.  
On the contrary, when the Fourteenth Amendment provides a broad protection, e.g., suspect/quasi-suspect class or fundamental right, then Congress’s § 5 enforcement power is broad, and the Court gives more deference to Congress’s enforcement of civil rights legislation. Here, judicial review is akin to rational basis review, with high deference to Congress regarding the means and ends chosen to advance the government’s interest, congruence and proportionality, and reviewing the legislative record.  
In Lane, the Court held that it would use an “as applied” approach to determine whether § 5 legislation meets the congruence and proportionality test. In applying this “as applied” test, the court will compare the scope of the statutory remedy as relevant to the circumstances raised by the plaintiffs to the threat to Fourteenth Amendment rights in the context raised by the plaintiffs.

APPLICATION
	This statute is/is not a constitutional exercise of Congress’s enforcement powers under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment because it does/does not meet the Court’s congruence and proportionality test.
1.	The first step is to determine what text of the Constitution, e.g., the Fourteenth Amendment, is triggered and if Congress even has enforcement power.
2.	If so, the next step is to determine the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment right as defined by the Supreme Court (broad or narrow), and the nature and the degree of the injury or threat of the injury to that right (broad or narrow). What must plaintiff prove? What defense may defendant assert?
3.	Next, the Court will determine the scope of the remedy provided by the challenged legislation. What is the statute’s standard for finding that a state defendant has violated the statute? What must the plaintiff prove? What does the plaintiff not have to prove? What defense may defendant assert?
4.	The Court will then compare the scope of the right as the Court defines it with the nature and degree of the injury or threat as defined by the statute to see if it outlaws a great deal of constitutional behavior. You can make counterarguments.
5.	Even if it outlaws a significant amount of constitutional behavior, this is permitted as long as it is congruent and proportional response to the Fourteenth Amendment problem that Congress is trying to remedy or prevent.
6.	Then determine if Congress’s action is congruent and proportional to the harm/threatened injury to the Fourteenth Amendment rights, applying the appropriate standard of judicial review in terms of the means-ends fit (i.e., how narrowly tailored the statute is) and legislative findings.
7.	The Court will also look to see if the statute, as applied to a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs, is congruent or proportional under the new Lane as applied congruence and proportionality standard.
8.	Analogize to one or two cases.
Case examples
●	In Boerne, the RFRA’s sweeping prohibition of state action that even incidentally burdened religion failed the “congruence and proportionality” test because it outlawed a vast range of constitutional activity without any indication of a significant threat to Fourteenth Amendment rights. Given this lack of “congruence and proportionality” between means and ends, the Court concluded that RFRA went beyond the enforcement of the existing Fourteenth Amendment rights and, in essence, redefined those rights.
●	In Kimel and Garrett, which both involved non-suspect classifications, age and disability respectively, the Court required legislative findings and evidence of a “significant pattern” or “widespread pattern” of unconstitutional behavior of states. In these cases, the Court closely scrutinized the quality of the evidence in the legislative record, and subjected the legislation to a standard or review equal to or more stringent than intermediate scrutiny.
●	In Hibbs, the Court upheld the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) as valid § 5 legislation with respect to the gender classification at issue, suggesting that the Court will employ a more deferential form of review when evaluation civil rights legislation designed to protect members of a suspect or quasi-suspect class and/or fundamental rights. In performing the congruence and proportionality analysis under Hibbs, the court used a very deferential standard of review, both in terms of the means-ends fit, i.e., the relationship between the Fourteenth Amendment right and Congress’s statutory remedy, and in terms of the legislative findings/record required to demonstrate a pattern of unconstitutional behavior by states.
●	In Lane, the plaintiffs used wheelchairs and could not access courts while also using their wheelchairs, so they challenged to ADA as applied to wheelchair access to courtrooms. Although a vast majority of the ADA was constitutional under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, the section regarding access to courtrooms was unconstitutional as applied to these particular plaintiffs.
●	In Morrison, the Court held that Congress may not regulate solely private activity through its civil rights powers.
CONCLUSION
	Thus, the statute does/does not satisfy Boerne’s “congruence and proportionality” test, and should/should not be sustained as valid legislation under Congress’s § 5 enforcement powers.

## Spending Power

ISSUE
	At issue is whether or not [this statute] is a constitutional exercise of Congress’s Article I § 8 spending power.

RULE
	Congress has power to spend pursuant to Article I § 8 of the Constitution. Congress may tax and spend to pay national debt, provide for the common defense, and provide for the general welfare of the U.S.
	Congress can induce states to waive their sovereign immunity by conditioning receipt of federal funds on waiver, but the government may not coerce states to broadly waive their sovereign immunity in order to administer/enforce federal regulatory priorities. See N.Y. v. U.S. If Congress induces states to waive their immunity, it must do so clearly so the Court may conclude that a state’s acceptance of federal funds constituted a waiver of immunity.
	When evaluating whether a statute is a constitutional exercise of Congress’s spending power, the Court will apply the four-part test outlined in South Dakota v. Dole, which held that Congress may engage in conditional spending provided that (1) the spending is designed to advance the general welfare (near complete deference to Congress’s legislative judgements on the meaning of general welfare), (2) unambiguous conditions are attached to the receipt of federal funds (clear statement rule), (3) a relatedness requirement that there is some nexus between the conditions and federal interest in the particular national project/program funded/expenditure, and (4) that the conditions do not breach some other constitutional provision, prohibition, or right.
The line between inducement and coercion is not so clear, but falls somewhere between Dole (where the Court determined the conditional spending was an inducement) and Sebelius (where the Court determined the conditional spending was coercive). In Sebelius, the Court struck down the Medicaid Expansion component of the ACA as coercive. The Court said that Congress oversteps the boundary line from inducement into coercion “when pressure turns into compulsion,” and the state is left with no choice. When Congress crosses this line, it is likely the Court will strike down the legislation under the Tenth Amendment (directed solely at a state entity that commands the state in its sovereign capacity to adopt and/or administer a federal law/policy that exceeds the scope of the limitation that the 10th Amendment) provided there is no other lawful way Congress could directly engage in the regulation the conditional spending seeks to effect.
When the condition and spending are part of the same program, the Court is likely to find Congress’s exercise of its spending power constitutional. If a conditional spending program is imposed on states which amends an existing program, the Court will ask whether the spending (1) amends an existing program or (2) creates a “new” program that Congress is requiring states to adopt, by a shift in kind instead of merely in degree. If it amends an existing program, then it is probably a constitutional exercise of Congress’s spending power, but if it creates a new program, then coercion analysis applies, and the Court will ask whether the financial inducement offered by Congress was so coercive as to pass the point at which pressure turns into compulsion. At this point, it is likely the Court will strike down the legislation under the Tenth Amendment (directed solely at a state entity that commands the state in its sovereign capacity to adopt and/or administer a federal law/policy that exceeds the scope of the limitation that the 10th Amendment) provided there is no other lawful way Congress could directly engage in the regulation the conditional spending seeks to effect.
APPLICATION
1.	Is the spending designed to advance the general welfare? (or pay national debt or provide for the common defense)
a.	Near complete deference to judgement of Congress, anything short of something outrageous
2.	Is there a clear statement of conditional spending in the statute where unambiguous conditions are attached to receipt of federal funds?
3.	Is there some nexus between the conditions and federal interest in the particular national project/program funded/expenditure such that it satisfies the relatedness requirement?
a.	Conditions on federal grants may be illegitimate if they are not related to a federal interest.
4.	Does the statute breach any other constitutional rights?
a.	Examples
5.	Does it amend an existing program? Is it part of a new program?
6.	If part of a new program, does the statute cross the line from inducement to coercion?
a.	In Dole, Congress conditioned receipt of federal funds on states passing a 21 years of age drinking limit. There, the federal highway funds at issue amounted to .02% of the state’s budget, and the Court held that this amount was low enough that the conditioned spending was persuasive, not coercive.
b.	In Sebelius, on the other hand, Congress conditioned state Medicaid funding on state’s agreement to adopt a federal Medicaid program as part of the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA). There, the federal government conditioned 10% of the state’s federal budget on the adoption of the Medicaid provision of the ACA, an amount the Court argued left states with “no real choice,” and thus amounted to coercion, and was unconstitutional.

CONCLUSION
Thus, [this statute] is/is not a constitutional exercise of Congress’s Article I § 8 spending power.

## The Dormant Commerce Clause as Structural Limitation on State and Local Power

ISSUE
	Did a state law discriminate between in-state and out-of-state interests in a way that burdens interstate commerce in violation of the dormant commerce clause?

RULE
	Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce under Article I, § 8 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court interprets this clause as implying a prohibition against state interference with interstate commerce, and this implied prohibition is known as the “dormant” commerce clause. The policy behind these powers is to bind the states into a more unified body nationally.
	The dormant commerce clause will be triggered when there is a state law that discriminates between in-state and out-of-state economic interests, or that in some way burdens interstate commerce.
A state law that discriminates against out-of-state economic interest in order to protect or advance local, in-state economic interests has a protectionist purpose and is thus unconstitutional.
A state law that has a non-protectionist, permissible goal, but that overtly discriminates against interstate commerce or out-of-state economic interests are subject to a virtual per se rule of invalidity. To overcome invalidation, the state has the heavy burden of showing that (1) there is a neutral, non-protectionist, legitimate state interest in the overt discrimination (i.e., environmental or health interest) AND (2) there is no less restrictive, less discriminatory means available to achieve that non-protectionist, legitimate state interest.  This is a very difficult test to pass.
A facially neutral state law that has a significant incidental impact on interstate commerce may be sustained if (1) there is a legitimate state interest, (2) the means of regulating is rationally related to the ends chosen by the state law, and (3) the local state interests advanced by the state law outweighs any burden imposed upon interstate commerce and out-of-state interests. Here, the Court may consider whether the states used the least burdensome and available non-discriminatory means available.
The market participant doctrine is an exception to the dormant commerce clause. This doctrine distinguishes when a state is acting as a market regulator (enforcing laws) from when it is action as a market participant (business). When a state acts as a market participant, the dormant commerce clause does not apply. A state is a market participant when it spends money, purchases, sells, or engages in commercial activity in a way similar to a private citizen. If, however, a state acting as a market participant attempts to impose its restrictions “downstream,” the court may conclude it was acting as a market regulator. See South-Central Timber v. Wunnicke.
Another exception to the dormant commerce clause is that States can discriminate in their own favor, such as by imposing subsidies to state residents. United Haulers. Another exception is that Congress may also authorize or prohibit states from acting in ways that courts would find violated the dormant commerce clause.

APPLICATION
1.	What is the state’s asserted interest? If it is protectionist, then the regulation is unconstitutional. If it is not protectionist, go on to step two.
2.	Is the statute overt discrimination or facially neutral?
a.	Overt Discrimination
i.	Look for geographic classification or movement across state lines = likely overt discrimination
Case Examples
●	In Philadelphia v. New Jersey, the court held that a state may not discriminate against another state’s articles of commerce on the basis of origin. There, NJ passed an overtly discriminatory law prohibiting states from shipping waste across its borders, and City of Philadelphia sued and won alleging a violation of the dormant commerce clause.
●	In Maine v. Taylor, Maine passed an overtly discriminatory law that the Supreme Court upheld under the dormant commerce clause. There, the statute prohibited the importation of out-of-state live baitfish, which is a form of environmental protectionism, but the court said this was fine because (1) there was a neutral, non-discriminatory legitimate environmental  interest (protecting Maine bait from disease) and (2) no alternative means because there was no way to screen out the non-native species and no way to prevent the importation of bait diseases.
b.	Facially Neutral
i.	What is facially neutral?
1.	Almost anything that does not implicate geography.
ii.	there is a legitimate state interest
iii.	the means or regulating is rationally related to the ends chosen by the state law, and
1.	Court normally defers to legislative judgements, particularly w/r/t health and environment.
iv.	the local state interests advanced by the state law outweighs any burden imposed upon interstate commerce and out-of-state interests
1.	Court balances local interests with burden on interstate commerce
2.	Court will consider if state used least burdensome and non-discriminatory means available
Case Examples
●	Hunt v. Washington, Court held that a facially neutral statute still violated the dormant commerce clause if it discriminated against interstate commerce in practice. Here, NC adopted a regulation that required all apples containers to display “USDA grade” on their containers or nothing at all. The Court held the statute failed under the Pike v. Bruce Church discrimination analysis because the labelling requirement was already the status quo in NC, so NC had a competitive advantage over all the other states that would have to spend money to be compliant, so it thus unconstitutionally burdened interstate commerce.
●	In Kassel, a state law that only marginally furthered the state health and safety purpose of limiting the length of semi-trucks violated the commerce clause because it overly burdened interstate commerce (most companies had longer trucks, so everyone was having to drive around Iowa to make deliveries).
c.	Exceptions
i.	Market Participant Doctrine
Case Examples
●	An example of market participation (allowed under Dormant Commerce Clause) was in White v. Massachusetts Council where the mayor’s executive order that a certain percent of employees on a construction project had to be from MA. The Court found that the mayor was acting as a market participant because he was regulating in-state labor, even though the construction companies hired for the project were from out-of-state. Anyone within such a jurisdiction can be regulated within that jurisdiction.
●	An example of market regulation (not allowed under Dormant Commerce Clause) was in South-Central Timber v. Wunnicke, where the Court held that a state could impose burdens on commercial transactions within the market in which it is a participant, but could not go further and regulate extra-territorial markets. There, Alaska’s regulations left timber buyers no choice of where to process their timber, so Alaska’s actions exceeded the narrow scope of the market participant exception to the dormant commerce clause. If Alaska had merely provided a subsidy to timber sellers that processed their products in the state, it would have been acting within its constitutional rights as a market participant.
ii.	State discriminates in its own favor?
Case example
●	In White v. Massachusetts, it was OK for the mayor to order that private construction companies operating construction jobs in MA hire a certain percentage of MA residents, because that is allowable discrimination on the part of the state in its own favor.
iii.	Congress authorized states to act in ways that would otherwise violate the dormant commerce clause, or prohibits states to act in ways that would not otherwise violate the dormant commerce clause?
CONCLUSION
The state law did/did not discriminate between in-state and out-of-state interests in a way that burdens interstate commerce in violation of the dormant commerce clause and thus the Court will find that it is unconstitutional/constitutional.
